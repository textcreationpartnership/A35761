            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALthough the French tranſlation, of the Holy Bible, made by the Doctors of <hi>Louvain,</hi> can, by no means, be comparable to the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, clearneſs and faithfulneſs of that which is read among us, yet, (to fit, my ſelf to the guſt of our Adverſaries,) I have drawn from their Tranſlations (and not from ours) the moſt part of the places of Scripture, which I make uſe of in this little book, namely in the ſecond and third parts; to the end, they might not wrangle with us about words, as many of them doe, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly theſe new Methodiſts againſt whom I have compoſed this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Onely let me inform you, that in
<pb facs="tcp:42025:3"/>three or four paſſages which are nothing to our controverſie, I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to correct that in the Greek and Latine texts which theſe Gentlemen had too evidently turned falſe, by in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency (as I am willing to believe) and ignorance, and not by malice. As for example in the ſecond part <hi>Chap. 4.3. pag. 124.</hi> I produce the firſt verſe of the Goſpel of S. <hi>John,</hi> in theſe words, the word was God, and not as theſe Doctors have expounded it, God was the word, whereof the two conſtruction which theſe words are capable of, <hi>Deus erat verbum,</hi> they chuſe to follow that which is leſs to purpoſe, and which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conſuſion which it brings to the contexture of the Apoſtles thoughts, does manifeſtly overturn the words of the Greek text,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhews that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot of neceſſity, be the predicate, but the ſubject of the prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſition, as thoſe, who have any knowledge in the Laws and uſe of the Greek tongue, know well enough. So in the Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> ſee how they tranſlate the words of S.
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>Paul, expectantes beatam ſpem,
<pb facs="tcp:42025:3"/>&amp; adventum gloriae magni Dei &amp; Servatoris noſtri Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſay they) the bleſſed hope, and the coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this God, whoſe advent we expect, from our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, we expect the coming of God, and we expect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the coming of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, an interpretation, neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent nor advantagious to the Church; for firſt, the Greek text cannot bear it which binds and ties up all theſe words, great, and our Saviour, in the ſame bundle by means of the particle
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the Apoſtle put into their heads
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, obliging us neceſſarily to take them, not as names of two perſons, one of which is called God, and the other Jeſus Chriſt, but as two different qualities, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one onely and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, which is altogether the ſame with the great God, and the Saviour, whoſe advent we expect; but this ſame interpretation is alſo prejudicial, for it takes away from the Catholicks a
<pb facs="tcp:42025:4"/>clear and invincible proof of the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus Chriſt, for if you follow it, ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt be our Saviour (which the Samotoſateniens and Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans confeſs,) yet ſtill he is not our God, and this is that which they ſtruggle for principally. No body then can blame me for leaving the <hi>Louvain</hi> verſion in this place to follow the Greek Text in tranſlating this paſſage <hi>Part 2. Chap. 4.3. pag. 124.</hi> where I produce againſt the hereticks, expecting the bleſſed hope and the coming of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. That which I have changed <hi>(part 2. Chap. 8. 1. pag.
106.)</hi> in the ſecond chapter of the firſt of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is leſs important, Love the brotherhood, inſtead of which our adverſaries Bible ſaith, Love bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, leaving out the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is in the Greek.</p>
            <p>So in the firſt of S. <hi>Luke</hi> I read, and therefore that which is born of thee holy, ſhall be called the Son of God <hi>(Part 2. Chap
4. Sect. 7. pag. 92.)</hi> therefore the holy one that ſhall be born of thee, as they of <hi>Louvain</hi> have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, contrary to the Faith of the Greeks
<pb facs="tcp:42025:4"/>who ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, which ſaith likewiſe, <hi>quod naſcetur ex te Sanctum,</hi> &amp; not, <hi>qui naſcetur ex te Sanctus.</hi> As for the ſmall change of words in the <hi>2 Cor. chap. 5. verſe 8.</hi> where we ſay, we have a good will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be out of the body, and to be with the Lord, inſtead of that which is in the
<hi>Louvain</hi> bible, I have a good will better to be out of the body, we have done this only to ſweeten the manner of ſpeaking, <hi>avoir bonne volonte meiux eſtre</hi> is rough and unknown in our language, and the Greek and Latine texts do no way oblige us to interpret it ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe are (if my memory doth not cheat me) all the paſſages in which I have varied from the <hi>Louvain</hi> verſion in divers other places I bear with its faults, becauſe they do no great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the juſtice and truth of my cauſe, although there are ſome of them which teſtifie (in theſe Doctors) a paſſion unworthy of the quality which they take of interpreting the Word of God, as among others, when in, <hi>Pet.

               <p>SOme years ſince certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſtarted up, who, to render our Religion odious, publiſhed, that it could not be proved by the Scriptures; which nevertheleſs, according to us, is the only thing capable to ground our Faith upon. Their invention was found ſo plauſible, that many of our adverſaries have reduced all their dialectiques to it; thinking that to defeat us, there needs no more, but to demand ſome expreſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal paſſages upon every Article of our Confeſſion of Faith, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42025:6"/>can preſs that demand home he is the man that muſt overcome us. This eaſie way of arguing hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed Diſputants among them: and inſtead (as at firſt) of ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conferences concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and not permitting any but Prieſts to diſcourſe it, now all ſorts of people hunt after it even to the Sempſtreſs and Scullion, and ſo by this fine method, become teachers in an inſtant. But now to ſhut their mouths and to arm ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their little punctillios, I have undertaken briefly to prove our Faith by the Scriptures; And that I may proceed as I ought, before I enter upon the matter, 'tis neceſſary for me to clear two points, The one is, what thoſe things are which we are obliged to prove, and the other is, by what means we are obliged to prove them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>That we are obliged to prove by the Scriptures the things only which we believe, and not thoſe which we reject.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS to the firſt point it is evident that our Faith is that which we have to prove, that is to ſay, the things which we believe true in Religion, and by the beleif of which we hope to obtain Salvation. As for other things which we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and which are not included in our Faith, we are not obliged to ſay any thing of them. If any one believes them it belongs to him toprove them, and to ſhew the truth of them by convenient reaſons: it ſufficeth us who do not believe them to hear and then anſwer by good and pertinent arguments. For in all diſciplines, it belongs to him that impoſes an opinion, and will oblige others to believe it, to make the truth of that opinon appear, it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42025:7"/>being evident (without that) no one is tyed to believe ſince reaſon does not oblige us to believe any but what is true. From whence does already appear the extream injuſtice of thoſe new Diſputants, who demand of us not onely a proof of that which we believe, but alſo a formal rejection of that which we do not believe; and when it is their part to ſhew the truth of that which they believe, they deſire us to produce ſome paſſages, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſhood of what they believe; for example, they are not contented that we prove by Scripture, that the Son of God is our Mediatour, which is preciſely that which we believe, but they preſs us ſtill to produce ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in Scripture, which rejects and condemns this propoſition, that the Saints are our Mediators, which is that which they do, and that which we do not believe. They would have us not only to furniſh our ſelves with paſſages which eſtabliſh the Sacrifice of the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but with others too which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally rejects the pretended propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice of the Maſs, which they believe and we do not. Likewiſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42025:7"/>they pretend, that beſides the paſſages which ſay, that Jeſus is the head of the Church which is one of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith, we ought to put in another, which ſaith that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the head of the viſible Church, which is (as every one knows) one of the Articles of their Faith and none of ours, and becauſe that is not produced, they aſſert we are not able to prove our Faith by the Scriptures, and therefore we are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to embrace theirs. Can any one imagine a more irregular piece of injuſtice. The law orders that he that puts an action ſhould be obliged to prove it. It is enough for one that is accuſed to ſhew the nullity of the proofs of the adverſe party. No right, no law, no cuſtome, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo injuſt, hath ever obliged the accuſed to prove by affirmative wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that he hath not done that, which they charge him with; he is quitted ſo ſoon as it appears that the reaſons and allegations of the accuſer are nulled; and from hence comes the proverb of the Lawyers, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grounded upon natural juſtice, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42025:8"/>it belongs to him who layeth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to prove it; for there is a reſpect to be had to the right of the action as well as to the action it ſelf. So as it belongs to him who ſuppoſes a fault to prove it; ſo alſo it belongs to him who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a right to make proof of it; as for example, if <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe that according to the right of the Romanes, a houſe ſhould return to the vender after having been fifty years in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the buyer, it belongs to me to produce ſome Roman law expreſly containing this depoſition, and if
<hi>I</hi> cannot produce this clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, my pretenſions will evidently come to nothing, and no man will be obliged to believe it. But if inſtead of doing this <hi>I</hi> ſhould preſs the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors to produce me a paſſage of the right of the Romans expreſly import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Sellor ſhould not be put into the poſſeſſion of the eſtate alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and in caſe of his not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch a paſſage of right, I ſhould proteſt againſt him. Who has patience ſufficient to bare ſuch an impertinent procedure? But nevertheleſs 'tis this exactly which the Diſputers of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42025:8"/>age hold. They pretend that 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of divine right that the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worſhip their Hoſt, that he partakes of the Sacrifice of their Altar, that he acknowledges the Pope of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be head of the Church. And inſtead of producing ſome paſſages of divine right, which ſay that their Hoſt ought to be adored, that the Maſs ought to be our ſacrifice, and the Pope our head, they preſs us to prove that this is not ſo, and if we do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch proofs, they proteſt that our Faith is not to be proved, nor theirs to be refuted by Scripture. What man is there ſo blind who ſeeth not that it belongs to them alone to prove, what they believe, what they preach, and that which they would perſwade me to, and to me only to hear their proofs and reſolve, and in caſe they cannot produce pertinent arguments, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that their pretenſions are vain.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE colour with which they paint ſo wicked a procedure, is, that our Churches in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, doth not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that which we believe, but joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejects, that which we approve not in the Romans belief. Theſe men take from thence an occaſion to make the whole paſs for Articles of our Faith, and demand of us proofs from Scripture for both theſe points; which is an artificial diſguiſe, it being evident, that although theſe things be expoſed in the ſame treatiſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we do not hold them to be of the ſame rank and nature. For as for thoſe which we believe as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God, we eſteem the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them neceſſary, it being not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42025:9"/>poſſible that a man ſhould be ſaved without believing, as for example, that there is a God, that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, that we are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live holily and righteouſly, and other things of the like nature. But as for thoſe which we reject, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added or maintained by the Pope, 'tis onely neceſſary not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them; for we are ſo far from thinking it neceſſary for us to have the knowledge of them, that we (as well as our Doctors) reject them formally and preciſely, and wiſh that they had never been ſpoken off, and that they may be Aeternally buried in the cave of errors from whence they came. For as Eating good meat is ſufficient to preſerve the life of man; nor is it neceſſary for him to know Hemlock, Aconite, or Antimony, or to know poyſons, 'tis enough that he is not ſo unhappy as to eat of them; even ſo
'tis in Religion; for to obtain ſalvation, 'tis ſufficient for a man that he believe the holy and wholſome truths communicated to us by the Lord Jeſus: there is no need that he ſhould know particularly the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42025:10"/>poyſons which the enemy hath ſcattered in the World, nor that he ſhould know exactly to what degree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of theſe falſe doctrines are poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous; 'tis enough for him that he is ſo happy as to believe none of them. To ſpeak properly the expreſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal rejection of an errour makes no part of Faith, for then Faith would have been imperfect before the birth of the error. Before <hi>Mahomet</hi> came into the World the Faith of Chriſtians was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſufficient, although it was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſeducements of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, and though it knows nothing of <hi>Marcion,</hi> of <hi>Manicheus,</hi> of <hi>Arrius,</hi> nor of
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> yet it is ſufficient to ſalvation, provided that it believes firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which Jeſus Chriſt hath revealed.</p>
               <p>There is then a great difference between thoſe propoſitions which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and affirmeth the truth, and thoſe which reject the error; The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our Fathers have ranked them in the body of the ſame declaration was not becauſe they were ignorant of this difference, but another occaſion obliged them to do it; for being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church, of <hi>Rome,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42025:10"/>having been calumniated of holding diverſe very ſtrange opinions,
<note place="margin">vide Epiſt. 10. <hi>the K. which is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Confeſſion of the year</hi> 1559.</note> in fine to make the King their maſter &amp; his ſubjects, their fellow Citizens, ſee clearly what their thoughts were about Religion, they not onely declared the belief they had of Chriſtianity, and of every one of the articles of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; but alſo what they thought of the doctrine and communion of the Pope, from which they had withdrawn themſelves.</p>
               <p>We ought then to diſtinguiſh care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully theſe two ſorts of articles which this reaſon joyns and mixeth together, ſome affirmative and poſitive, declaring that which we believe; others negative and excluſive declaring that which we do not believe: the firſt lays down that which is our Faith: the ſecond rejects that which is not ſo: For example, theſe are of the firſt ſort, <hi>that there is a God. that he ought to be worſhipped with all our affections; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and God Eternal, that he was made man, that he hath taken our nature in the womb of the holy Virgin, that he dyed to expiate our crimes, that his blood hath waſhed and purged our ſouls from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42025:11"/>all ſin that he is riſen and aſcended into heaven, and there reigns at the right hand of the Father: that ſins are pardoned to men, by the grace of God, when they believe in the Goſpel, that believers are obliged to live holily; that Charity is neceſſary for ſalvation; that the Lord hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ſhould be baptiſed in the name of the Father Son and holy Ghoſt, for the remiſſion of our ſins; and that he hath likewiſe commanded us to celebrate the memory of his death in taking, eating, and drinking the Sanctified bread and wine, that this bread and this wine are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his fleſh and of his blood; that thoſe who believe and live according to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation, and that thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in him ſhall periſh:</hi> But theſe following are of the ſecond ſort,
<hi>That we ought not to adore the Hoſt of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor invoke their dead Saints, that the maſs is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory ſacrifice for the ſins of men, that the Pope is not the head and ſpouſe of the univerſal Church, that he hath no power neither directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the temporals of Kings and States of the world; that neither he nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42025:11"/>the Church which adheres to him, have the right of never erring in the Faith, nor are they the reaſon and grounds of our Faith, that it is not for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our works that our ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us, or that grace or life is given to us, that the bread which we break, and the cup which we bleſs in the Church loſeth not their ſubſtance, that none of thoſe who communicate at his table ought to be hindred from drinking of the Cup of the Lord: that neither the chriſm, nor the penitence, nor the ordainor, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, nor the extream unction are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that believing ſouls departed this life are not burned in the fire of Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since we believe the firſt Articles and that we preach and recommend them to men we are obliged to ſhew the truth of them, and ſince the moſt part of them are ſo obſcure that we have not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light enough to diſcover and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, it remains that we prove that God hath revealed them to humane kind. For theſe are the three ſources of all our knowledge, ſence, reaſon, and the revelation of God, now 'tis neither the ſins nor reaſon of man, that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to us that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42025:12"/>of God, or that thoſe who believe his Goſpel ſhall have the happy Aeternity; We cannot prove the truth of it then but onely by the means of revelation. Now all Chriſtians and namely thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (with whom we diſpute in this Treatiſe) confeſs that the writers of the Old and new Teſtaments were inſpired by God, and did write by the revelations of the Spirit, now we cannot more clearly ground the Truth of the Articles upon which our Faith conſiſts then by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are taught in theſe divine writings; Tis for this we acknowledg our ſelves obliged, and of which 'tis moſt eaſie to acquit our ſelves, as we hope, to make appear in this book. And as for the other Articles which are of the ſecond ſort, it belongs to us to juſtifie and make appear that the holy Scripture teacheth no where to believe what it ſelf rejects, as it teacheth no where that there is a Purgatory, or that the Pope is the Monarch of the Church, or that the Maſs is a propitiatory ſacrifice. For having once ſhewed that we ſhall have clearly juſtified that we have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exclude ſuch opinions of our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42025:12"/>Faith, ſince we hold, that all the things which we ought to believe, as neceſſary to our ſalvation, are taught in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; for that if theſe be not found there, <hi>Rome</hi> is in the wrong to believe and preach it as neceſſary, and have reaſon not to receive it in our belief. Tis an unjuſt cavilling to demand this of us further, that we ſhould furniſh them with texts, in which the ſecond ſort of Articles are contained, where, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is ſaid expreſly that there is no fire of Purgatory, and that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the head, nor ſpouſe of the univerſal Church, and to ſay for want of this the holy Scriptures, as we have it, is not perfect, is an impertinence fit onely to dazle the eyes of children; for the Perfection of the Scriptures (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ſuppoſition) conſiſts in that it teacheth all things that ought to be done and believed, for ſalvation: as the perfection of a book conſiſts in containing all the Truths neceſſary to the ſcience of which it treats. Will you ſay that the bookes which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath left us of Philoſophy are imperfect, becauſe they do not expreſly reject that which the Maſters of the ſciences have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42025:13"/>ſince his time opened? or that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of the antient writers upon elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are imperfect, becauſe they did not expreſly contradict theſe new lights which the phantaſie of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns boaſt of having diſcovered? Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is an infinite thing for which the ſciences cannot, nor ought not to have a good eſteem. Tis enough for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to have ſhewed all the truth of the things of which they treat: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would never be any thing perfect in this matter. For upon this account the <hi>Muſſilman</hi> will reproach our Scripiure becauſe it hath not expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematized his <hi>Mahomet, Mareion</hi> and the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> the <hi>David Georgiſts</hi> and all the other impoſtors will impute to it as an imperfection, not to have made an inventory of all their follies. What need was there that it ſhould black its paper with their names and dotages ſo many ages before their birth? 'Tis ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep me from it that ſhe hath ſaid nothing of them. The ſureſt and ſhorteſt means to keep the right way amongſt ſo many confuted ones, is to diſpiſe all that which the Scripture does not recommend, and not to diſdain to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42025:13"/>examine what ſhe doth not diſdain to teach us. It ſpeaks to me of God and of his Chriſt, what he hath done for me and what he requireth of me. It inſtructs and fills my ſoul with that wiſdome which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation. It is enough for me to be ſaved, I am contented with knowing ſo much. As for what the Pope dogmatizes beſides this, let him ſhew it me in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and <hi>I</hi> will believe it as I do the reſt; but if it be not to be found there, who can imagine but I muſt be ignorant of it. and cannot believe it without danger, faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of God,

               <p>BUt theſe new diſputants make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtop here to oblige us to their pretended method, ſaying that they have had them in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many ages ſince; thinking that ſufficient for them without being obliged to produce any other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or Doctrins of their Religion; that it belongs to us, who conteſt with them, to make their wrongs appear, by clear, and inviolable proofs. It is a word which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have in their mouths and which they believe cannot be anſwered. But in truth we can ſay nothing more vain nor leſs pertinent, for if this poſſeſſion (as they call it) might be alledged in the caſe, the Apoſtles of Chriſt would have wronged the Heathens about their Religion ſeeing they poſſeſſed it far
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42025:14"/>long before; the Jeſuits would do wrong to the Chineſes, if they ſhould endeavour to drive from their hearts the idolatry and worſhiping of Pagods which they have poſſeſſed time out of minde, truth and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhould leave in mankind the error and vice which they found eſtabliſhed there, for fear of violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſtly the right of their long poſſeſſion. The old man will have little to maintain himſelf againſt the new, and philoſophy ought not to yield to the Goſpel; upon this account we alſo ought to return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their yoak as that of our firſt and moſt ancient Maſters. But God forbid that a little word ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſhould ever make ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous a prejudice to the right of God of his Chriſt and of his truth: we confeſs clearly that where there is a queſtion made about lands or houſes or any one thing which is, and which is ſeen in nature, the poſſeſſion may be alledged, and that it belongs to him who turns out the poſſeſſor to ſhew that he held it unjuſtly, and to make it appear
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42025:15"/>by good titles that the things belongs to him, in our conteſt with the Doctors of <hi>Rome</hi> there is nothing like this, they preſs us to believe with them the Purgatory the Maſs and other articles. We deſire them to ſhew us the truth of them of which we can yet ſee but little. Inſtead of ſatisfying ſo juſt a requeſt they alledge that they have them in poſſeſſion and ſo conſequently are not obliged to prove any of them; certainly if they think to make the world believe things mearly upon their ſaying them, without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the truth of them, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to us a poſition evidently unjuſt and tyrannical, For a man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before he knowes the thing to be veritable, and he cannot without denying his nature yield an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire faith to that which is to him either ſall or doubtful. Thoſe who will perſwade him to any thing are neceſſarily obliged, by the right of nature, to demonſtrate to him that it is true either by ſenſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and if the thing be above ſenſe and reaſon, let it be done by divine
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42025:15"/>revelations, it remains then that theſe gentlemen renounce this poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which they alledge to us, ſince tis ſo contrary to the rights of our nature, and that they make it their endeavour to demonſtrate to us that which they deſire to perſwade us to. They are in poſſeſſion to demand belief of things doubtful and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: and as for me I am in poſſeſſion to believe nothing but thoſe things the truth is of which they make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me. My poſſeſſion is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently more antlent then theirs; 'Tis but reaſon then that they yield to my right, and not that I ſubmit to their uſurpation. Moreover in civil cauſes where this maxim hath place the poſſeſſor is ſued and preſſed to forſake that which he holds: Here quite contrary, there are pretended poſſeſſors which contend with us and preſs us to enter into poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, for they would havee us believe what they believe, and 'tis this belief which they call their poſſeſſion; who ſees not not then that Fundamentally 'tis they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly who have begun this action
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42025:16"/>with us, and who ought, by onſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to ſhew us by good and lawful Doctrin that we have right to enter into this poſſeſſion to which they call us; we are ready to yield to them if they can make us ſee that that which they would have us poſſeſs is real. For to believe a thing which is not, a poſſeſſion, but a dream and an error, 'tis the heritage of the wicked to whom the wiſe man gives nothing for his poſſeſſion but the winde. Truth is ample and ſpecious and can receive poſſeſſion. Error on the contrary is a nothing which cannot properly be ſaid to be poſſeſſed by any. Untill then they do ſhew us the truth of the things which they believe, 'tis in vain for them to boaſt of their poſſeſſing them. That which is not, is not poſſeſſed. The feild of which one alledgeth the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in the Court, is a thing which appears, and of whoſe exiſtence no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can doubt. Here the purgatory, the Sacrifice of the maſs, the all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfulneſs and infallibility of the Pope the tranſubſtantiation of the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and in ſhort all their pretended
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42025:16"/>poſſeſſions are things which our ſenſe perceives not and which our reaſon cannot find out. That very thing then of which they pretend a poſſeſſion, obliges them to ſhew the truth of it by the Scriptures, ſince it doth not appear in nature. For to alledg the poſſeſſion of a thing which one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make out to any one, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mock the world, 'tis to pay it with illuſions and chimaeras. So 'tis clear notwithſtanding this allegation, that our adverſaries are obliged to ground the Articles which they lay down, upon good and clear doctrins of Scripture: and for us who will not receive them, tis ſufficient for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our refuſal, that no part of them can be found in that authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique inſtrument of the revelation of God, which both parties acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; to conclude then it remains that to prove our faith by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we are only obliged to ſhew that the things we lay down and firmly believe in religion, are taught in the ſcriptures, and that thoſe which we do not believe are not taught there.</p>

And nevertheleſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two paſſages do formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in ſo many words expreſs what they would conclude from them.

Our methodiſts laugh at it and demand a formal paſſage and ſay that the conſequences are faulty.

And if one cannot prove by the Scriptures, except it ſpeaks in ſo

How comes it then that <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles ſhewed it by this ancient Scripture? it is be cauſe they ſhewed divers things in the Scripture from whence it neceſſarily followed; for they gathered together all the marks of Chriſt contained in the books of the old Teſtament, from whence they formed this propoſition, he who has ſuch and ſuch qualities, who is born at ſuch a time and in ſuch a place who doth, ſuffers, and teaches ſuch and ſuch things, is the Chriſt: this being once ſo put, they conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply to their Jeſus all the marks

Since the Lord and his Apoſtles uſed this way, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that a propoſition is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and valuably proved by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, when one ſhoweth that it evidently follows from the things which are contained in it; although it be not there it ſelf expreſſly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Why ſhould he command that we ſhould ſearch for other things then thoſe which are directly expreſſed there? all the circumſtances of the paſſage ſhew that he wiſheth them to learn who is truly the Chriſt. But this cannot be drawn from antient Scriptures but only by conſequences.

               <p>In a word, you muſt either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the cauſe of God and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and convictions of the Heretiques or proceed in this manner.

Let us give an Arian to one of our Methodiſts to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or convinced; which way will he take? how will he prove the conſubſtantiality of the Son? he cannot alledg one exact text for it; for it is clear, that in the whole Bible there is not one of that nature, and he cannot take advantage of the texts which ſhew this truth ſince they do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42025:24"/>not exactly expreſs it, for the law of his Method forbids him the uſe of this ſort of proofs. Will he uſe the Authority of the council of Nice, or of the Church which he pretends is Catholique? but this would be to deceive himſelf and not to diſpute, this would be to alledge for proofe of the queſtion, the ſame thing which is directly in queſtion. For if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſhould appeal either to the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean faith or to the authority of the Catholique Church, he would not be an Arian. That which made him renounce both theſe, is the beleif that you will prove it to him. You muſt neceſſarily then leave him in an error, becauſe your pretended Method hath diveſted you of all the means of drawing him out of it. You can prevail no better againſt a Sabellion, an Eutichian, or in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, againſt any of the Heretiques who denie the Church any of her poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beliefs not expreſſed in ſo many words in the Scripture.

               <p>But this method doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprive us of the uſe of the Scriptures againſt thoſe who receive them either all or in part. It renders likewiſe all truths unuſeful to us, the knowledge of which God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the nature of men taking from us diſcourſe or reaſoning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is not poſſible to explain them to be uſeful either for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or conviction of the ignorant; For according to theſe new maxims every one will demand formal proofs of that which one would perſwade them, and will hold himſelelf oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to believe any thing, beyond thoſe very things which nature hath taught him. The Pagans will reject the unity of the Divinity, becauſe it cannot be drawn but by conſequences from our General notions, he will receive none of the arguments, which you will uſe to eſtabliſh the Juſtice, goodneſs, and Power of God, the truth of the Scriptures, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church and other ſuch like grounds of Chriſtianity, becauſe you have taught him that theſe reaſonings are but meer dreames, and none of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42025:25"/>their concluſions is worthy of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured beleif. Briefly there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any method ſo perplexing and troubleſome as this, which renders all the differences of philoſophy and Religion Aeternal, without leaving us any means to determine them. For ſince, that to make them agree it will not ſuffer us to imploy any other that an expreſs and formaldeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the Authority of which theſe two parties ſhould be agreed, it is clear that their debates will never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, ſince it hath its birth from that ſame thing which this method wants to determine it. For if in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principle there ſhould be found any ſuch deciſion of their controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, they would not enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt about it; for example, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts will not let any one make uſe of any one thing in Scripture to prove that the Pope is not the head of Church, if there be not ſome paſſage which ſaith expreſly that the Pope is not the head of the Church. Who ſees not that tis to flie the deciſion of the controverſie, and deſire the continuation of it for ever? for to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42025:26"/>demand of me to determine it, is a condition according to all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon, impoſſible to be done, it being not credible, that the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries who acknowledge with me the Divinity and truth of the Scriptures, ſhould bare me down that the Pope is the head of the Church; though it denies it formally and in ſo many words.</p>
               <p>If we deſire then to end our differences we muſt abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this Method, and proceed that very way which they ſo unjuſtly condemn, by proving all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, by the principles ſo well known to both parties, and thoſe are by the grace of God, the oracle of the old and new Teſtament, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining doubtful things by certain, clearing the obſcure by evident, and perſwading thoſe things. which they reject as falſe, by the connexion and dependance which they have one with another, that they confeſs them true. This is the true Method which one ought to follow in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and which indeed all maſters of all Sciences have followed, thoſe

'tis ſufficient (anſwers the Orthodox) if you but only acknowledge his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for though it were not written his nature of it ſelfe would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenly draw this name from it.

And upon this Groand the Heretick having replyed that the Fathers had called the Son conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42025:32"/>is that (ſaith the Orthodox) the ſenſe and intention of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which hath moved them to uſe that word which is not writ, or have they ſaid it of their own Authority? it is (ſaith the Macedonian) the ſence of the Scripture which hath moved them to it.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42025:36"/>the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſpouſe of the Church, and the Monarch of the World; that out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion there is neither Grace nor Salvation; that his judgements are infallible oracles, and that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith 'tis impoſſible he ſhould err; That 'tis from his hand only, that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scriptures, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Teſtimony which he gives them, they ſhould have no more weight with us, then <hi>Aeſops</hi> ſables or the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Shew us written in any one of the books of the Old and New Teſtament, that there is a place bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hell where ſome ſouls ſanctified by the blood of the Son of God are burned, that there are Altars upon the earth, where Jeſus Chriſt is realy ſacrificed by a mortal man for the remiſſion of our ſins. Let us ſee a paſſage, which ſaith expreſly that we ought to render adoration to your Hoſt, which you Name <hi>Letrcia,</hi> or that we ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Images of Saints departed, and kneel down before them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42025:37"/>their Spirits, and acknowledge them for our Mediators. I would not have you ſay that all this can be concluded from Scripture. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand according to your example preciſe and formal paſſages; either permit me to prove my Faith by conſequences, or renounce yours, full of ſo many things of which you cannot read one word in the Scriptures. Here you have much more intereſt then I. For my Faith conſiſteth of leſs Articles then yours; and the Articles which I believe, are for the moſt part ſo clearly and expreſly laid down in the Scriptures that I need no logick to draw them from it. 'Tis enough for our eyes to read them there; In ſtead of which, the beliefes which you and I conteſt about are ſo far from the words and ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the greateſt logick in the world is not ſufficient to draw them from it. Here to unravel your ſelves from theſe ſtraits, you will not fail to alledge the authority of your Church. But beſides telling me of that, you go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42025:37"/>me doubtful things, by that which is as much, or rather more doubtful, and by this you evidently renounce the procedure of them whom you call your Fathers, for if the authority of the Church, ought to decide matters here, why did not they interpoſe it in their Diſputes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if it be an ill proceeding to ſay either prove your Faith by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and formal paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſuffer me to prove mine by conſequences; why did they uſe it againſt the Arians? ſay what you pleaſe, you cannot turn it ſo but it will manifeſtly appear to be a great precedent for me againſt you to prove that you Diſpute like the Arians, and I like the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers:</p>

God, whoſe Wiſdom is infinite, never affirms any thing, without Knowing all the conſequences, which can be drawn from it, ſo that we need not fear that he will go back from his word, or deny any Doctrine to be his that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42025:39"/>can reaſonably be concluded out of his word Since then that all things that can be lawfully inferred from the Holy Scripture are unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true and Divine, it is clear, that one doth ſufficiently prove the truth and holineſs of a Creed, when he ſhews that it follows from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions expreſſed in the Holy Scripture, without any need (as formerly the Arians and now the new Methodiſts pretend) to ſhew it in ſo many words.

               <p>But theſe men demand of us here, how we can aſſure our ſelves that the conſequences which we draw from the Scripture are good and lawful? for (ſay they) reaſon is ſometimes abuſed, concluding from a principle that which cannot truely be inferred from it. <hi>Arians</hi> and
<hi>Eutichians</hi> who demand formal Paſſages of the Chatholicks did not they pretend to conclude their falſe and pernicious opinions from divers places of Scripture where notwithſtanding they were not? <hi>Neſtorius, Palagius,</hi> and before them all <hi>Origen,</hi> were deceived in the ſame manner; and there is not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, any Hereſie which hath not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42025:41"/>endeavoured to ground it ſelf upon the Scripture by falſe and abuſive diſcourſe.

I do not think it ſtrange that an
<hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſhould make this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, ſince his impiety obliges him to confound all knowledge in an infinite and remediſeſs incerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But that men who make profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and whoſe intereſt tis to preſerve Faith, Aſſurance and Credulity in the world, ſhould propoſe to us a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which rums all theſe things from top to bottome, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis either an impudence or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream paſſion. For conſider (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) how far this fine diſcourſe goeth, reaſon (ſay they) is faulty therefore we cannot be aſſured of the concluſion which it draws from the Scripture. But if this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be good, what aſſurance can we have? Firſt what will become
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42025:41"/>of this ſo much bragged of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Catholick Faith which they have alwaies in their mouths? it will be accounted to them no other then a meer in diſcretion.</p>
               <p>For whether they will or no, 'tis our underſtanding which receives the things of Faith, which conſiders them, and is lead to believe them by the reaſons of truth which it ſeeth in them. If our underſtanding by miſtakes and abuſes ſometimes makes its aprehenſions and concluſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, our faith muſt neceſſarily be ſo too. The conſent of the people, the ancient and uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Majeſty and brightneſs of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Beauty, Order, and pomp of the miniſters, the light of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine protection, and ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, may perſwade you that
<hi>Rome</hi> is truely the Church of Jeſus Chriſt; but (I ſay) how can you be ſure of it, ſince this reaſon to whoſe report you give credit is falſe and if it may be faulty in other things why not in this? and if you have from this Principle, upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42025:42"/>which depends all the Roman Faith but a doubtful and floting opinion, what aſſurance can you have for the reſt? but beſides their Religion this diſcourſe ruins all learning. For if reaſon by the faults into which it ſometimes falls, doth not deſerve that one ſhould yield it any certain and aſſured conſent, we ought to doubt, according to their ſuppoſition, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a right line falling perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon another right line makes two right Angles, and whither a ſquare deſcribed by the ſide ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right angle of a triangle is equal to two ſquares deſcribed by the two other ſides; whither all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are compoſed of matter and form, whither the liver be the Source of veins, whither <hi>Senna</hi> purgeth Melancholy, and of all other things in ſhort which are demonſtrated in Mathematicks, natural Philoſophy, Phyſick, and other ſciences, becauſe this reaſon which teacheth them is a cheating Miſtris. We ſhall not be able to be aſſured whither the whole be bigger then its part, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you take away equal things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42025:42"/>from equal things that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains will be equal. For (theſe new Scepticks will tell you,) how do you know but this reaſon which is abuſed in ſo many other things is not ſo here to? but
'tis worſe ſtill, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the knowledge of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this diſcourſe takes from us, moreover, all the apprehenſions of our ſenſes. If that faculty which ſometimes chances to deceive us can aſſure us of nothing, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us can truſt any of his ſenſes, ſince 'tis evident, that ſometimes they repreſent things to us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then they are? the eye makes that Tower which is ſquare ſeem round, makes the ſtraight oare crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and robs the Sun, Moon, and other Stars of the greateſt part of their grandeur. The taſt and the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt touch of our ſences are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſtaken. So that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts will not be aſſured of any one thing which is conveighed to us by our ſenſes. They will doubt whither ſnow be white, and believe but by halves that fire is hot and Ice cold, and will not dare to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42025:43"/>that Honey is ſweet and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood bitter, they will believe that the light of the Sun, the roundneſs of the heavens, the Motion of the winds, the flux of the Sea, the courſe of Rivers, and the Viſages of men, of their neighbours and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, are nothing but cheats and illuſions. And if this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reaſon and ſenſe be once taken away, what will become of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of piety and virtue, all which proceed from an aſſured knowledge and firm reſolve, without which they do not ſo much as deſerve the Name of vertue and Wiſdom? what will become of the myſteries of peace and war? and all the functions in which the ſociety of men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and conſequently families, Towns, and States? and in ſhort what will become of all humane life? for as natural bodies cannot move but upon ſome thing fixed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, ſo our minds cannot act but upon ſome fixedneſs and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Belief and perſwaſion are as the hing upon which they turn themſelves; without this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42025:43"/>move, but beſides the wrong which this pernicious imagination doth to men, it is infinitely abuſive to the providence of God, who (if we reckon after this manner) would have given the ſuperintendence of all his works, and the keeping of his truth to a thing blind and deceitful, and incapable of bringing him any glory. And tis clear that this error had never been advanced neither in the ſchools of Chriſtanity, nor any other Religion, if they had but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little heart for the honour of God and the ſalvation of men. The new Academy alone had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly produced it, judge then in what deſpair theſe Methodiſts were, who for the defence of their cauſe were conſtrained to raiſe up this Pagan Idol which hath been dead and buried ſo long ſince. To take from me the liberty of juſtifying my Faith by the Scriptures they ruin their own, they put out the light of Siences, they bring to nought ſence, they offend the Lord and wrap up humame kind in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal darkneſs. What blind paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

Theſe are ſaculties naturally right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one capable of their functions, but ſometimes they meet with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes which hinders them from acting ſo. For as to ſenſe, who knows not that its errors comes either from the indiſpoſition of the Organs, from the Scituation of the object, or from the quality of the medium which is between them? as for example, 'tis the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42025:47"/>with which the tongue of a ſick man is moiſtned which makes it taſte all meats bitter, and to thoſe who have Jaundies, 'tis alſo the ſpreading of that humour which dieth all objects yellow, but tis the too great diſtance from the ſun, which makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us much leſs then it is, and which blunts the Angles of a Tower, which we ſee a far off, figuring it to us round when it is really ſquare, and which makes the two ſides of the end of a long Gallery ſeem to be very neer each other, in fine 'tis the diverſity of the medium through which we ſee, which makes an oare appear to us in the water as if it were bent and crooked when it is really ſtreight, except in theſe and the like caſes the eye alwaies to doth its duty faithfully, and the other ſenſes likewiſe do theirs; ſo that it being moſt eaſie to know for a truth whether the functions of our ſenſes are ſo well diſpoſed or not, 'tis an inſupportable error to conclude that we are not able to aſſure our ſelves of any one of their reports, under pretence that it happens to deceive
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42025:47"/>them, when they fail of any one of the conditions neceſſary to perform their function well. Now 'tis the ſame in reaſon. If ſhe concludes wrong, 'tis certainly becauſe ſhe takes that for a true thing which is not ſo, or that for clear and certain which is obſcure and doubtful. As when our adverſaries conclude from that which the Lord ſaid to <hi>St. Peter,</hi> thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> that their Pope is by right the Monarch of the Chriſtian Church, they conclude falſly, becauſe they take that for an evident truth in Scripture which doth not ſo much as appear there; <hi>viz,</hi> firſt that our Lord in theſe words, promiſeth the Monarchy of his Church to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that their Pope is the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>St. Peter</hi> in this quality. But if theſe two things which they take for truth were truth, then that which they conclude from them muſt neceſſarily be ſo too, and he to muſt be out of his ſenſes who denies the conſequences of them: And this neceſſary connexion of propoſitions with their concluſions is a work,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42025:48"/>not of the mind and reaſoning of man, but of the will of God, as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> expreſly remarkes. The truth of conſequences (ſays he) and conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions which propoſitions have one with another, hath not been inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but conſidered and remarked by men, to be able either to learn or teach it; for it is perpetual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely eſtabliſhed in the reaſon of the things themſelves, for as he, who counts the degrees of time, doth not make them himſelf; and he, who ſhewes the ſcituation of places, the nature of animals, of plants, or of Stones, doth not ſhew the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by men; and he, who ſhews us the ſtars and their motions, ſhews us nothing made and eſtabliſhed by any man; in like manner he, who ſaith, when the conſequence is falſe, 'tis not poſſible but the thing from whence it follows ſhould be falſe alſo, ſpeaks moſt truly, and doth not make the thing to be ſo, but only demonſtrates that it is ſo

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42025:50"/>which it hath made uſe of to ſee it. As when the Apoſtle ſaith that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a man, you conclude, then that he hath a Soul, the ground of your concluſion is the ſaying of the Apoſtle and not the faculty or act of your reaſon. All that your reaſon hath done, is, that it hath found in the Apoſtles words that which is really ſo. Now this is not to give us Faith, but to receive it and to do that which is not onely permitted but commanded. If it teacheth any thing of its own growth, if it makes its inventions paſs for Oracles, tis but juſt to be condemned. For uſurping that which belongs to God onely; but if that which reaſon believes and perſwades others to, hath been taught by the word of God, if that was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe believed it, that which ſhe hath ſeen there, and that which ſhe hath done to the end, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might ſee it there, cannot be imputed as a crime to her, as if ſhe attributed to her ſelf, in doing this, to be the foundation of our Faith.

               <p>BUt they produce another difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon this point, let it be ſo (ſay they) let the conſequences take place; then when that is done we can receive no concluſions for divine but thoſe which one draws from two propoſitions both of which are layed down in Scripture, if one be not drawn from the word of God but from ſenſe or humane reaſon; we cannot receive that which follows
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42025:51"/>from it, unleſs it be for a humane truth, that is to ſay doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, becauſe in arguing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion alwaies follows the weakeſt part, as Logicions have obſerved; for example, if you diſpute thus, he who hath created the heavens and the earth, is the true and eternal God worſhiped heretofore by the Iſrealites, Now Jeſus Chriſt hath created the heavens and the Earth, he is then the true God worſhiped heretofore in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they will make no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perhaps to receive this concluſion for a Divine truth and worthy of an intire and certain belief, becauſe the two propoſitions, from which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, are both of them in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. But if you reaſon thus, a Body which is in heaven is not at that time in the earth, now the Body of Chriſt is in heaven, therefore it is not in the earth, and ſo you think to oblige them by that, to hold, this concluſion, that the Body of Chriſt is not on the earth for a thing certainly and Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty revealed, they will tell you that it cannot paſs for any more then
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42025:52"/>for a humane doctrine, ſince from two propoſitions from which one is drawn, <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt is drawn from maxims of reaſon only, and not from Scripture as the ſecond is. They triumph in this obſervation, and put it upon all occaſions amongſt their graveſt and moſt ſerious conference; but I ſay, firſt that if our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt were only concerned in it, there were no need to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, ſince that which is granted, is ſufficient for this diſpute. For it grants us that the propoſitions which are lawfully drawn from two truths, one of which revelation teacheth, and ſenſe, or reaſon the other, are true, at leaſt to the ſame degree as the truths which we learn by reaſon and ſenſe, and that we may give at leaſt the ſame kind of Faith to believe them in the ſame manner as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (for example) that Snow is white, the Heavens round, or that the whole is bigger then its part. Now we demand no more for our deſigne; for we imploy the moſt part of theſe diſcourſes, mixed with propoſitions of a different nature,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42025:52"/>only to overthrow their belief, and not to eſtabliſh ours; now to deſtroy a doctrine and render it unworthy of belief, 'tis enough to ſhew that tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome truth, and then one ought to hold it for falſe of what condition or origine ſoever that truth be which it oppoſeth, whither it be revealed or natural. For truth is a ſimple thing and uniforme, alwaies like to it ſelf; lies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wound themſelves, one falſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying another, but all truth; agree &amp; perfectly conſpire together, and tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould oppoſe or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw one another. If it be found then that the Doctrines of our adverſary are contrary to ſome truth, be it to that which ſenſe teacheth us, to that which we learn in theſcholof reaſon, or to that which divine revelation tells us, tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to juſtifie that they are by no means veritable, far from being (as they pretend) the articles of the Chriſtian Faith. For the Author of Nature, Grace, Senſe, Reaſon, and Faith, is one and the ſame God, who hath not deſtroyed in the ſchool of grace what he hath taught in that of nature (God forbid) but hath poliſhed and perfected in one what he had begun
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42025:53"/>the rough drawn in the other. So tis manifeſt that (far from being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, in this kind of diſcourſe, to imploy propoſitions contained in Scripture only) I can uſe arguments drawn intirely from ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without taking the propoſitions of which they conſiſt from revelation. As for example, if I ſhould conclude that the Euchariſt is not a humane body, becauſe a humane body cannot be held intire in a mans mouth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Euchariſt may be held in an infants, he would anſwer imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently that ſhould alledge that tis not Scripture but ſenſe and reaſon which learns us theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and therefore the concluſion is not a truth revealed. For at this time we have concern about that, the queſtion is not about the Maſter who hath taught theſe propoſitions whither it be ſenſe or Faith, but about their quality, whither they be true or not; for if they are both true, their concluſion is ſo of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and by conſequence your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which oppoſeth its inevitable falſe it being abſolutely impoſſible that two contradictory propoſitions
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42025:53"/>ſhould be both true, as this, the Euchariſt is a humane body, which is your opinion; and this other, the Euchariſt is not a humane body, which is the concluſion of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>But I ſay in the ſecond place that their maxim is falſe, that to infer a concluſion from authority and divine Faith, it behoveth that the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be drawn from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God; it is enough that one be revealed, and the other evident by the light of nature. The Church diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus againſt the fond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> every man hath a foul indued with underſtanding, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord is a man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath Soul indued with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; of the two propoſitions from whence this concluſion is drawn, the ſecond is in the Scriptures, the firſt is not there; but we have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the ſchool of reaſon; would you ſay under this pretext, that the concluſion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath a ſoul endued with underſtanding, is not a divine truth but a humane,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42025:54"/>learned from earth and not from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? but where is the infant that does not ſee, that God revealing to us, that his Son is a man, doth not reveal by the ſame means that he hath a body, a Soul, underſtanding, and in ſhort all the eſſential parts of the nature ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this word man. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one muſt ſay that in teaching us that Jeſus Chriſt is man, it teacheth us nothing, but ſimply ſtrikes the ear with the vain and unprofitable ſound of the word, for what is it to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt is man, unleſs he hath a body, Soul, underſtanding, and the other things of which the nature of the ſubject conſiſt, ſignified by this word man. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when the Scripture teacheth us that God hath created the earth, it teacheth us by the ſame means that he hath created <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Auſtral</hi> Countries, <hi>China;</hi> and the Iſles of the Sound, although it be ſenſe and reaſon, and not Scripture which teacheth us that theſe Countries are part of the Globe of the earth, and he would be impertinent to the hight, who ſhould ſay that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42025:54"/>hath not revealed to us, that God hath created <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Taproban,</hi> becauſe it ſimply tells us that God hath created the earth, without telling that theſe Countries are part of it. And ſo of the reſt, for God in his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſuppoſeth every where that thoſe to whom he ſpeaks are men and not beaſts; that they know, if not ſubtily and Phyloſophically (that which is not neceſſary for his deſign) at leaſt groſly and in ſome meaſure the nature of thoſe things, of which he ſpeaks to them; and by conſequence that they are capable of applying to every part of a ſubject what he hath told them in groſs, ſo that when he learns us ſome thing of a whole, it is clear that tis as much, as if he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all and every one of its parts to us perticularly, as when he tells us that Jeſus Chriſt is a man, tis as much as if he ſhould ſay, he hath a Body formed like ours, conſiſting of quantity, occupying a ſpace which is fit to it, moving it ſelfe in time from one place to another, in ſuch manner that its parts are not altogether in the ſame place, that he hath a Soul which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42025:55"/>reaſoneth, wills, loves, and in ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all the eſſential faculties of man. This is ſo clear that no Body ever can put it in doubt, even none of theſe new diſputants; the beſt Authors of their own party grant this. It is (ſaith the Biſhop of Canaries) a thing worthy of great and diligent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that we ought to hold for a part of the Catholick doctrine, not only that which hath been expreſly revealed to the Apoſtles, but alſo that which is concluded by arguments and by evident conſequences from two propoſitions, one of which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42025:56"/>the concluſion follows the weakeſt part is ill alledged to the purpoſe, by the methodiſts, in this diſpute; for the Maſters of Logick mean only by that, that if one of the propoſitions be particular and the other univerſal, or if one be negative and the other affirmative, or if one be of a truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable and the other of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; the concluſion will not be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal but particular, nor affirmitive but negative, not neceſſary but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, we grant it very willingly in this ſence, and if it ever happens to us, in diſputing againſt our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to conclude a propoſition univerſal or affirmative from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or from a negative, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that from a truth only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the concluſion ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, then we will ſubmit our ſelves to the laſh of their Logick. But to ſtretch this maxim further, and let it ſignifie, that if of the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which we uſe, the one hath been revealed from God and the other taught by nature, the concluſion ought to be put amongſt humane
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42025:57"/>maximes and not amongſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrines, 'tis a phancy ſo far from reaſon that I am aſſured that none of the Logicians have ever dreamed of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THeſe thing are ſufficient, in my judgement, to keep our ſenſe and reaſon from the troubleſome and unjuſt chains with which the new Methodiſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42025:58"/>tyrannically to bind them: Let us come now to our deſign, and briefly ſhew our Faith, that we may prove every one of the Articles of which it conſiſts, by Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be read there, or evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from thence.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, We believe that which heaven and earth teacheth us, that there is one God, eternal, infinite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, ſoveraignly good, wiſe, powerful, and juſt: Who hath created the Univerſe, and governs it by his Providence, nothing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Nature or amongſt Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Order or Permiſſion. We believe that this great God made Man, in the beginning of the World, according to his own image and likeneſs, and put him into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden,</hi> there to lead an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life, and that Man fell from this happy condition by his own fault, having diſobeyed his Lord, and that by this crime, he and all his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring remains out of the grace of God, Slaves of Sin and Death. We believe that God, moved by compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, towards his own work, hath
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42025:58"/>ſent his Son Jeſus Chriſt into the World, in the fulneſs of time, who hath done and ſuffered all things neceſſary to draw men from perdition, and to give them eternal Life; that this Son is the ſame God, with the Father, of the ſame power and eſſence, and ſubſiſted from all eternity with him, that he made himſelf man in time, and took to himſelf our nature, in the womb of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it perſonally with his Divinity, and after having preached his Grace to the people of the Jews, he was, at their accuſation, crucified by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and being dead upon the Croſs, and then buried, he roſe the third day from the dead, and after having converſed forty dayes with his Diſciples, he aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where the Father hath given him all authority and power. We believe that he reigns there now in a Soveraign glory, governing all the World according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that one day he ſhall come to Judge it for the laſt time. We believe that by his death he hath ſatisfied the juſtice of the Father, in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42025:59"/>as much as he hath ſuffered the pains for the Sins of humane kind, and that he hath acquired an eternal Salvation, and that the Religion which he hath given us to obtain this conſiſts in Faith and Charity; that the Father appeaſed by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, receives to mercy all thoſe, who knowing their miſery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of their Sins, do confide in his bounty, and believe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that he pardons them
<hi>gratis</hi> all their faults, and treats them as if they had never offended, and theſe being animated, and enlivened by Faith, live afterwards holily and Chriſtianly in Piety towards God, and Charity towards their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, according to the Goſpel of Chriſt. For he wills, that all his Faithful love, and ſerve God with one love and ſoveraign adoration, and that they have a true Charity towards all men; carefully keeping themſelves from violating their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Life, Chaſtity, Eſtates, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, neither in Deed, Word, nor Thought, every one ſubjecting themſelves to their Order and Laws
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42025:59"/>of their Civil Societies, and to the ſtate of the Country where they live: but that they entertain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular amity with the reſt of the Faithful, cheriſhing them as their own Brethren, uniting themſelves to them, that ſo there may be but one Body in Religion: and that for this end, there be amongſt them Paſtors and Superviſers, who have the overlooking of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adminiſtring to them, as well the divine Doctrine, as the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which the Lord hath left as tokens of his grace, and marks and ſeals of his Covenant, having commanded that his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt for the remiſſion of their ſins, and that they ſhould eat the Bread, and drink the ſanctified Wine, in commemoration of his Death, and communication of his Fleſh and Blood: We believe that although the truth of theſe things is moſt clear, yet men are ſo blinded by the Paſſion of their malice, that they would never underſtand them, if
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42025:60"/>the HOLYSPIRIT, true God, eternally bleſſed with the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER and the SON, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten their underſtanding, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts, that the light of this heavenly Doctrine may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and that God affords them this grace of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, giving it when, to whom, and in what meaſure it ſeemeth good to him. We believe, that to thoſe who ſhall have believed, and lived according to this holy doctrine, God will give his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preſerving them and taking care of them, and when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this Life gather their Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his repoſe, expecting the laſt day, in which having raiſed their Bodies, will lift them up with Jeſus Chriſt their Head, into an incorruptable Heaven, there to live eternally in his Glory; but the Wicked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous ſhall periſh, being puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Devil and his Angels in the torments of Hell.</p>
               <p>Reader, if thou art converſant in reading the Holy Bible, ſay in thy Conſcience, whether it be not too
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42025:60"/>great a boldneſs to deny, that theſe things are clearly contained there? onely hearing them named do you not as ſoon perceive, that theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Books, and eſpecially thoſe of the New Teſtament are full of them? How hard is it to find one verſe, which layes not down ſome of theſe inſtructions? Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs (becauſe they will have it ſo) we verifie them, Article by Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and to the end that they ſhould not (as tis their cuſtome) wrangle with us about words, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce paſſages of Scripture in thoſe very words, into which the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of our Adverſaries hath tranſlated them, and then ſay a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon every point, contenting our ſelves to mark the reſt in the Margint. For if we ſhould gather together all the places of Scripture, where theſe Doctrines are poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down or hinted, we muſt tranſcribe almoſt all of them, and as to the Scripture it ſelf, we ſuppoſe the truth of it without diſputing it in this Treatiſe, where the buſineſs is only to prove, that the Articles,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42025:61"/>whoſe belief we eſteem neceſſary to Salvation, are all found in the Book, which we hold for the Rule and principle of our Faith. For that is ſufficient to bring to nothing the calumny of theſe new Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who to convince the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of imperfection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us by the ſame means to have recourſe to the Authority of their Church, crying inceſſantly that we our ſelves who make ſo much account of Scripture, cannot prove by it all the things which we believe neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

                  <p>This is proved evidently becauſe the proprieties and works of the true God, are attributed to him in the Scripture: as firſt, His preſence in all

                  <head>5. <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt is that ſame God which is called the Lord or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in Scripture.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>This appears clearly. For ſince there is no other God but the Lord Eternal, (as we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scripture) the Holy Ghoſt being God, (as we have ſhown) it muſt neceſſarily be concluded that he is the ſame Lord eternal, ſince otherwiſe he would not be God.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this is proved moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently thus, he who hath inſtructed,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42025:91"/>ſent, and inſpired the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Old Teſtament is the true eternal God worſhipped hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Iſrael, as it appears through all their prophecies, now it is the holy Spirit which hath inſtructed, ſent, and inſpired them, 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. The holy men of God being inſpired by the holy Spirit have ſpoken. 'Tis he perticularly (<hi>Acts.</hi> 1.16.) who hath foretold that which we read in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 40. (<hi>Heb.</hi> 41.) 10. 'Tis he who ſpake by <hi>Iſai.</hi> (<hi>Acts.</hi> 28.25.) and commanded him to ſay that which we read in the 6 <hi>Chap. verſe.</hi> 9. of his prophecy,
'Tis he (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, 8.) who gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> the ordinance which we read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.2. 'Tis he (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15.) who ſpake in the 31 <hi>Chap. verſe</hi> 32. of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 'Tis he laſtly (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7) who ſaith in the 94 <hi>Pſal.</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 95.)
8. that which we read there: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then of neceſſity, that he is the ſame Lord Eternal, whom the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the Old Teſtament ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we clearly proved the Doctrine of the Trinity. That there
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42025:92"/>is three of them, the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it expreſly, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.7. There are three which gives witneſs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and theſe three are one,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. Teaching all Nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Spirit, be with you all, Amen. And when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was baptized theſe three perſons were manifeſted diſtinctly, the Father crying from heaven, this is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in whom I have taken delight; the Son receiving the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in his humanity, the Holy Ghoſt deſcending from heaven upon hm in form of a dove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16, 17. And that theſe three perſons are one and the ſame divinity, appears by what we have all ready ſaid. Now that the Father is the true eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God adored by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> all the Scripture ſaith it, and the words alone of Jeſus Chriſt,
<hi>John.</hi> 17.3. ſufficiently teacheth it, were ſpeaking
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42025:92"/>to the Father, this is life eternal (ſaith he) that they ſhould know the only true God. That Jeſus Chriſt is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the true eternal God, and that the Holy Spirit is ſo alſo, we have proved here above. Since then that all the Scripture profeſſeth, that this eternal Lord is one only God, as we have alſo juſtified, one muſt then of neceſſity conclude, that theſe three bleſſed and glorious perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; are but one and the ſame God; which is that which the Church nameth the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

               <p>THus have we ſhewn our faith by the Scriptures. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages are clear, and for the moſt part expreſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; which
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42025:98"/>acknowledge in their Verſion, which the Eaſt and Weſt, North and South read in common, ſince the firſt times of Chriſtianity to this minute, without their being able to reproach us, that we have violated the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, abuſed the Pricks of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, or the Accents of the Greek. The Conſequences are of ſo evident neceſſity that Children are capable of underſtanding them: So eaſie is it to prove, that the Beliefs which we have juſt now demonſtrated by Scripture, are common to all Chriſtians. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have explained &amp; cleared them in their Symbols and Councils. The Moderns have retained them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Changes which has happened in Religion. All the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the Chriſtian world have received them with an univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth not conteſt with us about them; ſhe makes a Profeſſion to believe them alſo. There is but <hi>Sabellius, Paul de Samoſate, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Fotinus, Manicheusi, Pelagius, Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> every one of whom debate ſomething of them with us, all Heretiques, being cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42025:98"/>by the Thunderbolts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church many hundred years ſince. They alone demand proofs of us, the others believe all with us: From whence it appears by the way, how falſe the Calumny of thoſe is, who accuſe our Religion of novelty or particularity. For what is there either more Antient or Univerſal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians than thoſe Creeds of which it conſiſts? Who can deny that the Catholique Church hath had them in all Ages? That <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf hath them not now? Whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity hath had any Opinion which I have not, it is another Queſtion; and upon which it falls out to conſider: Firſt, Whether this be a thing which hath been revealed by Jeſus Chriſt, and preached by his Apoſtles. And Secondly, ipreſuppoſing it to be a truth, that it is ſo neceſſary, that one cannot without believing it, have part in the Grace and Glory of God. But as to my Religion, that is to ſay, this faith which I have proved by the Scriptures, it is clear, that all the true Chriſtians both Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern are agreed in it; who by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42025:99"/>are all of my Religion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps I am not of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in all other things. They hold all my Beliefs, only I confeſs, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I hold not all their Opinions; ſee the terms upon which we are with thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> For they profeſs to believe the Articles which we have explained. All the difference ſprings from the Articles which they lay down to the confeſſion of which they would oblige us, and which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive. This is all our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. From whence every one may ſee the injuſtice of the new Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, who preſs us to prove by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal paſſages the points of our faith, controverſed between them and us: Whereas the Points of my faith (Gentlemen) are not controverſed, but thoſe of yours; as for Example, the Queſtion is not whether we ought to worſhip God and Jeſus Chriſt, which is a Point of my faith; but whether we ought to worſhip the Hoſt, which is an Article of yours. The Queſtion is not, whether Jeſus Chriſt is our Mediator, or whether the Oblation of his death is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42025:99"/>which are Articles of my belief; but whether the Saints departed are our Mediators; and whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Oblation of your Altars is a true, a properly called Sacrifice, which are the Points of your Faith. We do not diſpute whether we ought to call upon God, or hope for Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and fear Hell, which is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but whether we ought to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogue the Saints and apprehend the fire of Purgatory, which is your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 'Tis you then ought to prove your ſaith, &amp; not I mine. Since to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute well and lawfully, one ought to prove, not things which the parties are agreed on (which would be a ſuperflous labour) but thoſe about which they differ. Nevertheleſs to content your humour, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our faith by the Scripture. Let us ſee now if you can as eaſily finde yours there, and that which you add to ours, upon which indeed is all your conteſt.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>An Expoſition of the Principal Beliefs of the Roman Church, which we reject from our Faith.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FOr we confeſs voluntarily that we cannot believe, neither that which you teach, that Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of the world, beſides his being once offered upon the Croſs, is ſtill every day immolated, and truly and properly ſacrificed upon your Altars, under the Signes of Bread and Wine, for the expiation of the ſins of men; nor that which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe to this purpoſe, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, although it be in Heaven in Sovereign Glory, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding here below really and ſubſtantially under the Species of Bread and Wine which you conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate intirely under every part of the Species of the Bread and the Wine looſing their firſt ſubſtance, and being changed into that of his Body and Blood; nor that which you conclude,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42025:100"/>that all the faithful of the Lord are obliged, without ſcrupling, to render to your Sacrament the adoration,
<note n="*" place="margin">Cult. de Latria.</note> worſhip and ſervice due to the true God.</p>
               <p>We reject alſo from our faith, this which you aſſert in yours, that the Souls of ſome of the faithful, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been waſhed in the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all ſin, ought yet to be purged by, I know not what, ſubterranean flames, in a place which you name
<hi>Purgatory:</hi> Nor can we perſwade our ſelves to believe what you ſo firmly maintain, that ſinful men obtain the pardon of their Crimes not by faith alone (as we all believe) but alſo by the merits of their own works, ſuch (as moſt of you ſay) as they even merit Divine Grace, and life eternal.</p>
               <p>Neither can we receive that which you teach, that beſides this great God whom we adore, we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſerve the Saints departed; and beſides the love and honour which we bare them as perſons who have lived in the fear of God, and who now rejoyce in his Glory, we ought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42025:101"/>moreover to invoke them, pray to them, and have recourſe to their aide, and render as well to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages as to thoſe of Chriſt, a certain Religious Veneration, in kiſſing and ſaluting them, uncovering our heads and proſtrating our bodies before them.</p>
               <p>Leſs yet do we think our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged (as you do) to acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Head and Spouſe of the Univerſal Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to him a Sovereign and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Authority over all other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Biſhops, and even over Councils; and an infallible Light in the Faith, never erring in the deciſion of things which concerns it: and therefore we do not believe that the Laws which he hath made of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating certain Feaſts, and of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining certain days from certain kinds of meats does oblige the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>And as to the Miniſters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in particular, we do not believe (as you do) that they are obliged to abſtain from Marriage, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42025:101"/>calls <hi>honorable,</hi> believing that it is enough that they have the good qualities which is required in them in the firſt of <hi>Tim.</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Upon the Articles of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we confeſs that Baptiſm and the Supper are ſufficient for us, not being able (as you have ordained) to receive for true and proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chriſtian Religion; your Confirmation, Orders, Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Penitence, nor Marriage; nor do we believe (as you do) that the faithful are obliged before they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of the holy Euchariſt, to confeſs to a Prieſt all and every one of their ſins in particular, declaring to him the kinds and circumſtances of them, believing that it is ſufficient, that <hi>a man trie himſelf,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28,</note> and ſo eat of that bread, and drink of that wine of the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle preſcribes.</p>
               <p>In a word, we cannot believe that your Clerks ought to be exempted from the Juriſdiction and Subjection of Princes and States in the Country in which they live; nor that Princes and States ſhould be ſubject to your Pope, or to any other Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42025:102"/>Miniſter in his Temporal Concerns, as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, which you acknowledge as the Mother and Head of the Catholique Church.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Principle Articles of the Faith of our Adverſaries, which we will not receive. Let us conſider now as briefly as
'tis poſſible whether they are found in the Holy Scriptures. If we will follow their Principles, it will be very eaſie for us to finiſh all this Diſpute in one word. For ſince according to the Maximes of their Method we ought to hold for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures, nothing but what we read there, preciſely &amp; in ſo many words, the Conſequences being faulty and diſcourſe deceitful abuſive; who ſeeth not but by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion all the Articles which we have excluded from our faith, are out of the Scripture, and cannot be proved by it; it being clear that one cannot read there any one thing expreſly, formally, and literally in the ſame terms as they believe them and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them; and upon this account I ſhould be already at the end of my task. For ſince that according to us
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42025:102"/>the Scripture is the only Principal of faith, ſo perfect that we do not think that it is permitted us to receive into our Religion any Article of Belief which is not taught by the Scriptures: and ſince on the other ſide, none of the Articles which thoſe of
<hi>Rome</hi> lay down, can be read there, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe new Diſputers, the only Method to juſtifie a Belief by the Scripture, it follows clearly that my faith is all intire, and moſt agreeable to the Holy Scriptures (which is all the deſigne of this Treatiſe) ſince that which it believes is found there, and that which it doth not believe is not found there. But God forbid that we ſhould take advantage by the wrangling of our Adverſaries. We ſhall always acknowledge for true Doctrine of the Scriptures, that which can be clearly and neceſſarily drawn from thence; all that which they charge upon Reaſon being falſe, and not to the purpoſe, as we have ſhewed here above. Let us deal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly then, and examine whether their Beliefs which appear no where in formal and preciſe terms in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42025:103"/>Scripture may notwithſtanding be concluded from thence by ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and neceſſary Conſequences. We will recite here only thoſe which ſeem to them to be moſt ſtrong, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by a great number of them; which though uſed by their Authors are ſo weak, and (if I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſay it) ſo extravagant, that whoever hears them will think them the idle talk of a ſleeping man, rather than the diſcourſe of one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. For to what purpoſe ſhould I go about to ſpoil Paper, and loſe time to copy the Arguments of thoſe who conclude the Monarchy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from that which Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to St.

<hi>Abraham,</hi> but in Sacrifice to God, how can they prove that it was a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and not rather an action of thanks; ſince under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the propitiatory Sacrifices had with them an effuſion of blood?

'tis eaſie to finde out that the pure oblation of <hi>Malachy</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the worſhipping in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, which our Lord ſaith, and <hi>the oblation of our bodies as a living Sacrifice,</hi> as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks and our ſervice in Spirit, as he ſaith, and ſo conſequently not the Maſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But they alledge from the New Teſtament that Jeſus Chriſt in celebrating the Euchariſt, ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Do this;</hi> now to do, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſometimes to ſacrifice: but what neceſſity is there to take it ſo in this place? Who ſeeth not that,
<hi>do this,</hi> ſignifieth an action of which the Lord had ſpoken. Now he had ſaid nothing of ſacrificing (he ſpake not one word of that) but of eating and drinking. For after having given them the ſanctified bread to eat, &amp; the ſanctified Cup to drink, he adds, <hi>do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſhall not we take theſe words, <hi>do this,</hi> to ſignifie, to eat this Bread, and drink of this Chalice? St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains it clearly ſo, when after having rehearſed theſe words
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42025:106"/>of the Lord, <hi>Do this every time, and as oft as you drink of it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> he adds, <hi>for every time and as oft as you eat of this bread and drink of this Cup, you ſignifie the Lords death till he come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26.</note> The connection of this Verſe with the precedent evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that to do this, fignifieth eating of this bread, and drinking of this Cup.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They produced alſo, that our Lord in the 22 of St.
<hi>Luke</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cup of the Euchariſt, ſaith,
<note place="margin">

But I ſay, firſt, that although the words of the Lord in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> cannot be taken otherwiſe than in ſaying that the Holy Cup is ſhed for us; nevertheleſs it doth not follow that the Euchariſt is, to ſpeak properly, a propitiatory Sacrifice. What? is not the Water of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptiſm ſpilled for thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it? Do you conclude from hence that Baptiſm is a propitiatory Sacrifice? Many things make for us which nevertheleſs are not Sacrifices.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42025:107"/>The Chalice of the Euchariſt is it not uſeful and wholſome for us? Is it not given us to communicate to us the blood of the Lord, Grace, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our fins? It is enough to ſay truly that it is ſhed for us, there being no need to change it into Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to explain this manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But without coming to this one may juſtifie this otherwiſe. For ſince the Cup is the Sacrament of the blood of Chriſt, which hath been tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhed as a Sacrifice on the Croſs, to merit the remiſſion of our ſins; and ſince it is the cuſtom to give to the Sacraments the qualities and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the things of which they are Sacraments, none ought to think it more ſtrange that the Cup ſhould be ſaid to be ſhed for us, than that which St.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42025:109"/>of the Jews &amp; Pagans, with whom they pretend that it is compared, were of the ſame nature. Who ſeeth not that the Apoſtle in all theſe places doth not compare the action of the Hebrew and Gentile Sacrificers offering their Sacrifices with the action of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Miniſters, bleſſing the Euchariſt: But the action of the Hebrews and Gentiles every one eating the bread, and drinking the Chalice of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? And that he compares them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this point, that as one was a publike proteſtation which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews and Gentiles did to participate with the Altars upon which had been ſacrificed the fleſh whereof they eat, and to the Divinity to which they had ſacrificed them; ſo alſo the ſecond was a ſolemn and authentique act the Communion of which the faithful have with Jeſus Chriſt, and of the part which they pretend in his fleſh and in his blood? So that ſince 'tis impoſſible to have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and with the Devils together; the Apoſtle concluding that to eat meats ſacrificed to the Devil is a thing inconſiſtent with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42025:109"/>the marks and profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: behold how far he deſigne of the Apoſtle extends, and no farther.</p>

<note place="margin">Ibid. ver. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>That thoſe of Iſrael which eat of the Sacrifices were partakers of the Altar;</hi> it evidently follows, not that the Sacrifices, by the eating whereof they participated of the Altar, were changed into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Altar (which would be abſurd and prodigious) but that they were Sacrifices, having a Subſtance different from that of the Altar: and what an extragavant ſpeech would it be to ſay that thoſe who eat the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices participate of the Altar, as if the Sacrifice &amp; the Altar were one &amp; the ſame thing in ſubſtance; (for this

               <p n="4">4. But they lay great force upon that which the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in the following Chapter, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Euchariſt:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 29.</note>
                  <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall eat of the bread or drink of the Chalice of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And in the Verſe beneath he adds, <hi>that they diſcern not the body of the Lord.</hi> How can that be (ſay they) if the body and blood of the Lord be not really preſent in the Euchariſt? But firſt, they conclude not that which is in Queſtion. The Queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bread and wine change Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? and they conclude that the body and blood of the Lord are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Euchariſt; now they may be preſent there, and yet the bread
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42025:114"/>and wine not loſe their Subſtance. And
'tis very unlikely, that theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles infer, that that which he calls bread and Chalice, ſhould be in Subſtance one and the ſame thing with the body and blood of the Lord, that contrarily they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently preſuppoſe that they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subjects. For if the bread which one eats unworthily were the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, this language would be cold and impertinent; <hi>he who eats of this bread unworthily, is guilty of the body of Chriſt, and doth not diſcern the body of Christ,</hi> ſince upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it would be to ſay, that he who eats the body of Chriſt unworthily, is guilty of the body of Chriſt and doth not diſcern the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay that that which they draw from this Text (beſides its not being the Queſtion) cannot be concluded from thence. For he who receives the Baptiſm unworthily (as <hi>Simon</hi> the

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</note> And nevertheleſs every one avoweth that the Subſtance of Chriſt is not for all this really preſent in their Conſciences or in their perſons. And then why ſhould one any more infer that the body and the blood of the Lord are really preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, becauſe they who take it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily are guilty of his body, and do not diſcern it? who ſeeth not that this is an abuſing of the Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42025:115"/>thoſe who appertain to him, or to deſpiſe that which he hath inſtituted, and that which hath relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: As 'tis an abuſe to a Prince to deſpiſe his Embaſſadors, his Seal, his Arms, or his Eſſigies? And it is not ſufficient that the Euchariſt be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſt the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his body, and of his blood, &amp; the memorial of his death (that which all confeſs) to render this Propoſition true; whoſoever receives it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily is guilty of the body of the Lord, and doth not diſcern it, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming (as our Adverſaries do) that this body and this blood are really preſent there.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42025:115"/>of the Lord. But this Argument is ſo weak, that it hardly deſerves to be conſidered. For it ſuppoſeth a dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, and concludes wrong, which are the moſt irregular faults, that can be in reaſoning. Firſt then, he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that the Lord ſpeaks of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt in the 6th of St. <hi>John,</hi> which appears in no place in that Text, where the Evangeliſt makes no mention any where of the Holy Sacrament; it ſeemeth rather that one might induce the contrary from it.

And indeed the Lord ſhewed evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that by eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied coming to him, believing in him, and meditating on him, ſince in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42025:116"/>his own diſcourſe he aſcribes the ſame effects to theſe actions, as to thoſe of eating his fleſh &amp; drinking his blood. <hi>Who comes to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<note place="margin">John 7.35.41, 47.</note> and who believes in me ſhall never thirſt. Whoſoever ſeeth the Son and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him hath eternal life, and therefore I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> But although that which they preſuppoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord in the
6 of St. <hi>John</hi> ſpake of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, were as clear and true, as it is obſcure and doubtful, I always ſay, that they do not argue pertinently. Firſt, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that which is in Queſtion. For the Queſtion is not, whether the body and blood of Chriſt are preſent in the Euchariſt (which is that which they conclude) but, whether the bread and the wine loſe their nature there, and are there changed into the ſubſtance of the body and blood of the Lord, which they cannot infer from it, although one ſhould grant them what they could draw from it, it being clear (as we ſaid before) that the body and blood of the Lord may be preſent in the Euchariſt, and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42025:117"/>bread and wine not change their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But I ſay laſtly, that this which they would conclude from it cannot lawfully be inferred. For if becauſe we eat the body of the Lord and drink his blood in the Supper, it follows that the ſubſtance of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and his blood is really preſent there; then in the ſame manner it will follow alſo, that it is preſent in the Souls of all thoſe who believe in him: ſince that according to many Fathers, and the moſt part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> to believe in Jeſus Chriſt is to eat his fleſh and drink his blood;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17.</note> and ſince according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is <hi>by faith that Chriſt dwells in our hearts:</hi> it will follow that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſt is really preſent in our Baptiſm, ſince that thoſe who are baptized <hi>put on Jeſus Christ,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.</note> and are buried with him in his death:</hi> it will follow that the Subſtance of his blood is really preſent in the Souls of all the truly faithful,
<hi>choſen according to the Providence of God,</hi> ſince <hi>they are ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Apoc.</hi>
7.14</note> and in the Souls of thoſe <hi>who are come from tribulation,</hi> ſince <hi>they have waſhed their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42025:117"/>long robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> Now if one can eat the fleſh and drink the blood of Jeſus Chriſt in believing, and have him dwelling in his heart, and put him on, and be buried with him, and be ſprinkled with his blood, and be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made white in his blood, and nevertheleſs not touch really the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, why may not one in the like manner eate his fleſh and drink his blood in the Euchariſt, without his being there bodily? Who ſeeth not that theſe ways of ſpeaking ſignifie only vertue of the death of the Lord in them to whom he communicates himſelf by faith, and the Spirit giving them the ſame effects in reſpect of the ſpiritual life, which Meats, Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Liquors and Water with which one is cleanſed in reſpect of the temporal life gives us, ſuſtaining and preſerving us, making ſin die in us, covering the nakedneſs of our Souls, fortifying our hearts, cleanſing and purging us from all ſpiritual fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs? let us conclude then that this famous Tranſubſtantiation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42025:118"/>the principal piece of the Roman Religion, is neither expreſſed nor preſuppoſed in Scripture, it being not leſs impoſſible to diſcover it there by the light of Reaſon, than by that of Senſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LEt us come now to the fire of Purgatory, where they will have the Souls of the faithful ſatisfie for the temporal puniſhment of their ſins, before they enter Heaven. 'Tis ſad to ſee them ſweat to finde in the Scripture ſomething wherewith to blow up light, and maintain this fire. For this Opinion impaſſions them in ſuch a manner, that they that ſee it in all the places, where a Pit, a Lake, a Priſon, a Goal, a Fire, purging, refining, a refining pot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſpoken of.

And as as to that which is ſaid, that he to whom we have not uſed Charity ſhall be our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and ſhall deliver us to the Judge, 'tis the ſame manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like that in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Epiſtle to the

               <p>Secondly, They abuſe alſo the words of the Lord, where he ſaith, <hi>that the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghost ſhall not be forgiven,

But why ſhould not we rather ſay, that by the age to come, the Lord according to the Style of the Scriptures, underſtands the Age which ſhall follow after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead? and that it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that God will never pardon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42025:120"/>this crime to the men who are guilty of it, neither now, nor at the laſt Judgment? that he will never give them abſolution for it, neither in this life by the voice of his Spirit in their hearts, nor in the other by the mouth of his Son? Or why do not we ſay, that he means that this ſin ſhall be grievouſly and irreſiſtably puniſhed, as well in this Age with temporal pains, as in the other with eternal? For as remitting or pardoning a ſin ſignifieth not to puniſh, ſo the not pardoning it ſignifieth to puniſh it; yea, to puniſh it grievouſly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. In that great day the Lord will alſo remit the ſins to the faithful, but not to impenitent ſinners; and beſides what the thing ſaith of its ſelf, St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth it expreſly, where he <hi>prays God to have mercy on the houſe of Oneſiphorus in that day;</hi>

               <p>Thirdly,

<hi>Paul</hi> writes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42025:121"/>in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, If the work of any one be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs:</hi> but he ſhall be ſaved, <hi>yet as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the fire,</hi> or rather by the fire, pretending that this fire is that of Purgatory.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42025:122"/>of the Jews deprived of the refreſhments of the Divine word, and of the exerciſes of their Religion: If we muſt Allegorize, why ſhould not we rather bring this paſſage to the eternal redemption which the Lord Jeſus hath acquired to us by his blood, drawing his myſtical Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael (that is to ſay) his Church from the ſad and pitiful condition, where it was naturally, being a priſoner of the Devil, a ſlave of ſin, and guilty of the wrath of God, the true Lake where there is no water, ſince in that ſtate there is no confolation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Souls which they ſhut up in their Purgatory, notwithſtanding their griefs, have according to what they ſay,

Then was clearly accompliſhed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<note place="margin">Bell. de Juſtif. l. 5. c. 17 &amp;
18.</note> All that one can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully infer from theſe paſſages, is, that God hath promiſed to give eternal life to thoſe who live well and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that one day he will accompliſh perfectly this his promiſe; on this condition eternal life is a conſequent, an acknowledgment and a reward of holineſs and good works, which the faithful who labour and perſevere in their vocation may and ought to expect from God. But who doubts of any of theſe truths? all that we ſay is, that we muſt expect this reward only from the Grace of God, who hath promiſed and will give it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is moſt good, and not for the value and excellencie of our works, which (how good ſoever they be) are but our duty, with which we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42025:126"/>acquit our ſelves to God; incapable by conſequence of meriting any thing, it being clear that he who do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which he ought, and to whom he is obliged, acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only, and doth not merit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They alledge that the Lord ſpeaking of the happy,
<note place="margin">

<hi>that the faithful of Sardis ſhould walk with him in white clothing, becauſe they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it;</hi> and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the <hi>Theſſalonians, that they were afflicted to be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5</note> But I anſwer, that this word <hi>worthy,</hi> ſignifieth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and convenience of a thing, and not its merit. As when St. <hi>John exhorts the Jews to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8.</note> that is to ſay, convenient for the repentance, which it anſwereth, and not which it merits (for this would be <hi>ridicule</hi>) it is then in this ſcuſe that the truly faithful who live holily and perſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in piety are worthy of the Kingdom and white Veſtments of the

<hi>That he giveth affliction to thoſe who afflict you,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10.</note> and to you who are afflicted deliverance with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with the Angels of his power:</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>God is not unjuſt to forget your work and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which you have ſhewed towards his Name, in as much as you have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to the Saints, and do minister:</hi>

<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 44.10.</note> and again in another place, <hi>The Crown of Juſtice is kept for me, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to all thoſe who love his coming.</hi> But I ſay firſt, that this word Juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phraſe of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language ſignifieth very often benignity and liberality, and juſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, benign and gracious, as in the 112
<hi>Pſalm</hi> alledged by St. <hi>Paul, He
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42025:127"/>hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor, his righteouſneſs endureth for ever;</hi> from whence it comes that Alms which is an act of gratuity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence is called Juſtice in the
6th of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> In this ſenſe who ſeeth not that retribution of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to the faithful, is truly an act of the Divine Juſtice, that is to ſay, of his Grace and benignity; that 'tis an Alms which he giveth us. Secondly, I ſay, that it is juſt that God ſhould give life eternal to thoſe who have believed and obeyed, not that they have merited, but becauſe hehath promlſed it. As 'tis alſo a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to keep ones word in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing that which one hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nohem</hi> 9.</note> although one hath promiſed it but upon meer gratuity, without being obliged to it by the merits of him to whom one promiſeth it. In fine, in comparing the cauſe and caſe of the faithful with that of the wicked who afflict them, the one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving manifeſtly the right on their ſide, and the other the wrong; it is yet in this reſpect for the Juſtice of God to maintain the one and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42025:127"/>and puniſh the other. But this is not to ſay, that conſidering throughly the perſons and works of the faithful in themſelves; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this compariſon, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, which to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly merits the Heavenly Glory, with which the Father will one day Crown them <hi>gratis,</hi> according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>that life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, is a Grace of God.</hi> But there is no need to inſiſt much upon this Article, ſince that amongſt our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there are found great and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Authors, who openly reject this Doctrine, being far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that it is in the Scriptures, ſome diſputing that the good works of the faithful are not meritorious, by reaſon of the works themſelves, but only by reaſon of the Promiſe and Divine acceptance, as <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Vaga:</hi> Others, that ſuppoſing the Promiſe of God, yet they are not ſuch that the hire is due to them by Juſtice,
<note place="margin">See Bellar. of Juſtif. l. 5. c, 16.</note> but only by the liberality of God; as <hi>Durandus,</hi> ſo Cardinal

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42025:128"/>of ſpeaking which is found in

                  <hi>only let thy name be called upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, But ſay they, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the Old Teſtament, make mention of the Saints departed in the prayers which they put up to God, <hi>Have remembrance of Abraham,

But the queſtion is, whether we may, and ought to addreſs theſe prayers to deceaſed Saints, which cannot be drawn from this allegation by any good reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Moreover,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30.</note> they diſcourſe thus: Our Lord teacheth us that the Saints departed are as the Angels of God in Heaven;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.15.</note> now <hi>Jacob</hi> invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked an Angel: It is then permitted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42025:129"/>us to invoke the Saints. A feeble, a pitiful reaſoning. For firſt, the Lord ſpeaks of the ſtate of Saints after the Reſurrection; and the Queſtion is of the condition they are in now before the Reſurrection. Secondly, The Lord compares them to Angels, not generally and in reſpect of all the conditions of their beings (for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account they muſt conclude they will have no bodies after the Reſurrection, ſince the Angels have none) but only in reſpect of theſe things, <hi>viz</hi> that they will not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<note place="margin">Maldon. upon this paſſage.</note> as St.
<hi>Jerom,</hi> and after him the Jeſuit <hi>Maldonat</hi> remarks; in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection (ſaith the Lord) <hi>they ſhall neither marry, nor be given in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but ſhall be as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> And as to the Angel which <hi>Jacob</hi> invoked, who knows not that 'tis the Angel of the Covenant,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 15,

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42025:129"/>this truth againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> who would (as our Adverſaries at this time) bend theſe words to a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Angel, which we have no need to inſiſt upon any longer to clear.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They argue again thus; We pray the faithful living here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with us to pray to God for us, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded the
<hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>Coll.</hi> 4.3.1.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.25. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1 1.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18.</note> the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the
<hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> and the
<hi>Hebrews;</hi> and therefore why ſhould not we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſame office of the Saints departed? But firſt, who ſeeth not that although this reaſon ſhould be pertinent, it always concludes much leſs than that they would have it: for it hints only, that it behoveth to pray to the departed Saints, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; the other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whilſt they lived. Now he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them only to pray to God for him. He did not kneel down before them although abſent, to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to them, he erected no Statues to them, he conſtituted no Images to them, he did not proſtrate himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Repreſentations; nor did he offer them lighted Tapers, or make
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42025:130"/>Vows to them; nor did he pray them to command our Redeemer to defend him againſt the Enemy, to receive him at the hour of his death, and to heal the inaladies of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor is there any wiſe Chriſtian that will do or demand ſuch things of a living man; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account it will follow that all the Prayers where our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries demand theſe things of the Saints departed are unlawful, their own Reaſons (as much eſteemed as they are) permits them only to require the Saints to pray to God for them. But in the ſecond place who ſeeth not the extreme impertinence of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? We pray the living Saints to pray to God for us, we may then uſe the ſame towards them that are dead? I pray you what is it that gives them ground to argue ſo? What! is there not a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two? we ſee the one, we ſpeak to them, and hear the anſwers they make to our requeſts; whereas the other are ſeparated from us by a great and almoſt infinite diſtance, without being able to know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42025:130"/>whether they hear any of our words, without having any mutual and reciprocal commerce with them. We do not doubt, that as we thank God for their happineſs, they pray for ours, wiſhing the triumph of the Church which they know fights yet, upon the earth under the Enſigne of their Chriſt. But 'tis to mock the world to conclude from hence, that we may and ought to ſpeak to them as we do to perſons here below which are of our acquaintance. That which <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew by the revelation of God concerning what his Servant <hi>Gehazi</hi> had done being abſent,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.16.</note> and
<hi>Daniel</hi> that which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had dreamt.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Acts</hi>
12.34.</note> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and
<hi>Saphira</hi> had contrived, ſheweth, that the Lord can if he pleaſeth, diſcover the thoughts of our hearts, and the words of our mouths to the Saints who live in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (that which we have called in Queſtion) but not that he will, and doth it in effect, which is the point of this Queſtion, whereof we ought to be aſſured, to be able to addreſs our prayers to them. It cannot be

Firſt, they were not the Repreſentators of God, nor of any perſon whom he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any eminent Service of his Church. Secondly, Theſe Images were made, ſome for Types and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Symbols, as the Cherubims of the Ark and the brazen Serpent, the others for the ornament and inriching of the Temple only, as the Palms, the Oxen, and the Lions of <hi>Solomon,</hi> none to be honoured and worſhipped, which was ſo contrary to the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Divine men, that the people offering Incenſe to the brazen Serpent <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to ſtop the abuſe,

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42025:138"/>the Lord. For had not the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alſo as well as he the charge of feeding, common by his teſtimony to all the Miniſters of the word, and the commiſſion of all the ſheep of the Lord?

                  <hi>Preach the Goſpel to all Creatures, and the care of all the Churches comes upon me from day to day:</hi> 'tis true, that the Lord made towards him and repeated this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand three times,
<note place="margin">Cyril up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. John l. 12 64.</note> but (as ſome of the Fathers have very well obſerved) to aboliſh the failing of his three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, very far from thinking by this means to eſtabliſh the Monarchy of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to this, that the Lord being at <hi>Capernaum</hi> payed the Tribute-money for St. <hi>Peter</hi> and not for the other of the Apoſtles; that doth not infer any Authority of St. <hi>Peters</hi> above them. For it may be that it proceeded from ſome other conſideration, as, that the others had already payed it, or that they were not preſent when the Tribute money was demanded of our Saviour, or that they were not Inhabitants of
<hi>Capernaum,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, who had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42025:139"/>his family there. In brief, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be,
'tis a wonderful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſay, Chriſt hath payed the Tribute-mony for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St <hi>Peter</hi> was the Monarch of the Univerſal Church, and the Prince and Lord of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither can this be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of that place, where Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> numbring the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>The firſt is Simon, who is called Peter.</hi> For a Preſident is the firſt in his Chamber, and a Dean the firſt in his Aſſembly, nevertheleſs none can conclude that the Preſident is Lord of the Counſellors in his Chambers, or the Dean the Prince of his Brethren. I grant that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> either for his age, his capacity, his zeal, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration hath had the like advantage in the Company of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. he might have been the firſt of them, but yet not the Maſter, much leſs the Monarch of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And that ſufficeth to ſhew, that they cannot prove by the Scriptures this marvellous quality which they attribute to the Pope, of not being able to err in matters of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42025:139"/>faith. For ſince all the things which they alledge are grounded upon thoſe things which regard St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſeeth not that they infer nothing for the advantage of the Pope, except they prove by the Scriptures that all the right of St. <hi>Peter</hi> belongs to the Pope, that which I think they dare not ſo much as attempt to ſhew by the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I ſay as much of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of thoſe amongſt them, who attribute the Infallibility and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignity, not to the Pope (as at this time the greateſt part of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do) but to the Roman Church aſſembled in the Univerſal Councel. For all which they can draw from the Scriptures in favour of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſpeaks of the true Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, without amuſing our ſelves than to conſider the juſt value of that which is attributed to the Church in theſe places, whether that this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility and Sovereignty be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or real, it is enough to reſolve their Reaſons, to ſay, that they can conclude nothing for themſelves, until they have proved that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> are the true Church
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42025:140"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly, Now this Sovereign Authority which they give to the Pope and to the Church wch acknowledgeth him being impoſſible to be proved by the Scriptures, it followeth that all the things which depend on it are not grounded there. Such for Example is that diſtinction which they make between meats at certain days, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Chriſtians to eat fiſh and not fleſh in Lent and other-like times; the eſtabliſhing of Feaſts, the ſingle life of the Miniſters of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the retrenchment of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Cup to all thoſe who commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, except to him who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the Euchariſt, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things, for which they alledge, for the moſt part no other ſoundation than the Authority of the Pope, and of the Church, which depends upon him. At leaſt it is clear that they cannot prove by the Scriptures, all that which any one of them affirm. eth or uſeth for this purpoſe, it being ſo ſlight and ſo far from their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I do not think it worthy the relating.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Come now to the Sacraments, the number of which they have increaſed, adding five to the two which we allow of.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Ceremonie of the Confirmation, where the Biſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noints the perſon baptized with Oyl and Balm conſecrated after a certain manner, giving him a light box on the ear, and making the ſigne of the Croſs, ſayeth, <hi>I ſigne thee with the Signe of the Croſs, and confirm thee with the Oyl or Chryſm of Salvation, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> All this to ſtrengthen him, that he may be the better able to reſiſt temptations. Where is it that the Scriptures orders or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42025:141"/>us this Ceremony? Certainly it ſo little agreeth with the Scripture that <hi>Alexandre</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> two of the firſt and moſt famous Authors of their School held that it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted neither by Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Biel in 4. <hi>Sent.</hi> diſt. 7.</note> nor by his Apoſtles, as <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth writing upon theſe Sentences.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17.</note> that the Apoſtles laid their hands on thoſe who had been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Samaria.</hi> But what hath this in common with the Roman Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42025:141"/>that the Apoſtles anointed with Oyl, or conſecrated with the Signe of the Croſe thoſe upon whom they layed their hands. And as to the end for which they layed their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6</note> it appears from the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, which was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to them the extraordinary Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, as the gift of Tongues, and other the like things, which are very different from juſtifying Grace.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</note> of which there is mention made in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not being accompanied with any anointing or viſible Conſecration, can ſerve for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eſtabliſh the pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Roman confirmation, of which theſe things are the two eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning Repentance, we agree that it is neceſſary, and that the Paſtors have Authority to forgive ſins to thoſe who repent, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them to the impenitent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which the Lord ſaid to his Apoſtles,

               <p>Fourthly, For the Confeſſion, which they make part of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Sacrament, we believe that every faithful one is obliged <hi>to prove himſelf before he approacheth the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</note> For St.
<hi>Paul</hi> orders it expreſly. But none of the Divine Authors preſcribes to any Chriſtian to go and reveal to a Prieſt all his ſins, yea, even his moſt ſecret ones, before he communicates at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord. 'Tis true, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the words of St. <hi>James,

<note place="margin">Cajetan upon this paſſage.</note> The Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> one of their moſt ſubtle and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Writers, and a great Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Luthers,</hi> being ſent Legat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him into <hi>Germany,</hi> anſwereth there for us: <hi>I ſpeak not here</hi> (ſaid he, commenting upon this paſſage in the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> when he was above
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42025:142"/>threeſcore years of age) <hi>of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Confeſſion</hi> (as it appears in that which he ſayeth,
<hi>Confeſs you one to the other. For the Sacramental Confeſſion is not done mutually from one to the other, but to the Prieſts only.) But of the Confeſſion by which we diſcover our ſelves mutually one to another that we are ſinners, to the end they may pray for us, and of the confeſſion of faults committed of the one part and the other to appeaſe and reconcile us one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly, This ſame Cardinal confeſſeth ingeniouſly alſo,

                  <hi>That that paſſage which he alledgeth in the</hi> 5
<hi>Chap. of the Epiſtle to the</hi> Epheſ. <hi>to demonſtrate that Marriage is a Sacrament, is nothing to the purpoſe. Wary Reader</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> upon theſe words) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>doth not furniſh you with any thing in this place to prove that Marriage is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he ſaith not, this Sacrament, but this</hi> Myſtery is great, <hi>viz. of the words which St.</hi> Paul <hi>in the preceding Verſe alledged of</hi> Moſes. For this a man ſhall leave his father and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; ſhall cleave unto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh.</p>

               <p>Sixthly,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.22.
<hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note> As to the Orders we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the Apoſtles laid their hands upon thoſe whom they eſtabliſhed in charge, and that this Ceremony is holy and praiſe-worthy, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed carefully amongſt us in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Paſtors. But that this action is one of the common and properly-named Sacraments of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, neither Scripture nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth us.</p>
               <p>Seventhly. There remains now the Extreme Unction, which with a viſible Oyl, accompanied with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words, pronounced by the mouth of the Prieſt in form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, remits ſins to a ſick perſon, who is in extremity. And it is here that the Diſciples of the Methodiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly triumph, alledging a paſſage of St. <hi>James</hi> upon this Subject, very expreſs (as they pretend) and they begin the moſt part of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes by this laſt piece of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14</note> 
                  <hi>Is there any amongſt you that is ſick?</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>let him call for the Prieſts of the Church, and let them pray over him, and anoint him with Oyl in the Name of the Lord, &amp; the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42025:143"/>prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall heal him; and if he have committed ſins they ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let Cardinal <hi>Cajet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cajetan upon this paſſage.</note> anſwer once more for us. <hi>It appears</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by theſe words of the Apoſtles, and by the effects, that theſe words were not ſpoken of the Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, nor of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, but rather of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Lord Jeſus inſtituted in the Goſpel for the uſe of the diſeaſed. For the Text ſayeth not,</hi> Is any one ſick unto death?
<hi>but plainly,</hi> Is any one ſick? <hi>and ſayeth that the healing of the ſick is an effect of it, and ſpeaks not of forgiveneſs of ſins, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally; whereas this Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction is not given but at the point of death, and tends directly (as its form ſignifieth) to the remiſſion of ſins. And beſides St.</hi> James <hi>ordains, that for one ſick body they ſhould call many Prieſts, as well to pray for, as to anoint them, which is different from the Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>The Scriptures doth not teach that Miniſters ſhould be exempted from the Subjection of Civil Powers, nor that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath any right over them in reſpect of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Do not ſee that they can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably draw from the Scriptures the exemption of their Clergy, nor the Temporal Power of their Pope over the eſtates of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which they alledge, the Lord ſaid to St.
<hi>Peter,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.25, 26.</note> Of whom do the Kings of the earth take Tribute and Impoſts? is it of their Children or of Strangers?</hi> and St. <hi>Peter having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered of Strangers: Jeſus ſaith, then are their Children free.</hi> This I ſay, doth not prove that the Clerks are of divine right exempted from paying
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42025:144"/>Tribute to the Magiſtrates. For firſt,
'tis not evident that the Tribute of the <hi>Drachmas,</hi> of which the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, was payed to the Magiſtrate, and there is much more likelihood that it was the half Shekel which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Iſraelite at above twenty years of Age payed to God for the uſe of the Sanctuary according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 30th of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16.</note> which is nothing like theſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which the Magiſtrates raiſed. But although the ſame Queſtion ſhould be of a Civil Tribute
'tis clear that the Lord exempted none from it, not ſo much as himſelf. Now ſince the Son of God, even as he was Man was not of right ſubject to any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, this is not to ſay, that the Miniſters of the Church have the ſame right, ſeeing the great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difference which is between their perſons and his. In a word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apoſtles ought to rejoyce in this liberty by the beneficence of their Maſter, ſo long as he was on the earth; it doth not follow that they ſince his Aſcention into Heaven, nor thoſe who ſucceeded them in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42025:145"/>of the Word ought always to enjoy the ſame exemption. For ſo long as he was upon the earth they were his Family according to Civil Law, following and ſerving him, and as Domeſtiques had part in this his priviledge. But ſince he is retired from the earth as to his humanity, neither they nor we are any more of his Family according to Civil Law. For as we are his Spiritual and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Family in reſpect of Religion, he gives us not this Priviledge. For then one might ſay that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt enjoy it ſince every one in this ſenſe is of the Family of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to this power, let it be direct or indirect which thoſe of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> attribute to the Pope over the Eſtates of Chriſtians, even in reſpect of Temporals, I think it not neceſſary to conſider that which they alledge from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ground it upon; ſince they are things ſo weak, and ſo far from their purpoſe, that the greateſt and beſt part of our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have rejected their Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42025:145"/>and reject with us this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority of the Roman Seat, namely in this Kingdom,

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Reſolution of that which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pretend, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Articles have been taught by the Apoſtles, although they are not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SO evident is it, that none of the Articles of the Belief of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which we reject from ours can be ſhewen by Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To which they will anſwer, it may be, that although it be ſo, they have nevertheleſs been revealed by the Lord, and taught by word of mouth by his Apoſtles, the Scriptures not containing all the Articles of the Chriſtian Doctrines; of which many have been (as they ſay) given
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42025:146"/>and preſerved from hand to hand by a Tradition not written. But I ſay, firſt, that to conſider the thing exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſeemeth to me that the ſilence of the Scriptures upon theſe Articles is ſufficient to prove that they have been revealed, neither by Jeſus Chriſt, nor received and believed by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, nor by them given and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to their Diſciples for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines neceſſary to faith and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if at that time they had been kept in the liſt which
<hi>Rome</hi> at this time gives them, if they had been eſteemed the principal Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion, and the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and important parts of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; why ſhould not theſe holy men have made ſome mention of them, in the many Books which they have purpoſely writ upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, and which by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lord are come to us? Why did the four Evangeliſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them? the Acts make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them? How comes it that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and above all St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his fourteen admirable Epiſtles, ſo full and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42025:146"/>every where in Chriſtian Doctrine, have not ſaid one word of them? I do not now urge that theſe Books are the Cannon of Faith that they have been ſet down in writing to the end the Doctrine of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be preſerved entirely there. Let us ſuppoſe (ſince <hi>Rome</hi> will have it ſo) that they were written by chance, and without the deſigne of giving to us the whole body of faith. Yet one cannot deny but they have been written the moſt part of them upon matters of faith. Now who will believe that ſo many excellent perſons writing ſo many Books up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a Subject ſhould forget the principal, as by a conſort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſpiration? how happened it that in ſome place they did not ſpeak to us of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the pretended Soul of all Religion? Of Tranſubſtantiation, which is the ground of it; of the worſhipping of the Hoſt, the heart of Devotion; of the Veneration of Images; of private Confeſſion; of the Invocation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Saints; all exerciſes of Piety ſo exquiſite and ſaving? If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42025:147"/>thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> Why have they not in ſome places commanded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Pope, magnified his Authority, the only hinge upon which their faith turns, the life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of humane kinde, according to the Mximes of our Adverſaries? Now and ſome Ages puſt there hath not been written any Book of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion how little ſoever it hath been, where theſe Doctrines have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been met withal; and indeed if they were of that importance which they make them, it were to betray men to ſpeak to them of piety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching upon theſe. Let then the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, if they pleaſe a Letter only of Credence, an imperfect Rule, and in ſum, what they will; yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of many Books of conſiderable bigneſs, and it is no way credible but in ſome part or other there would have been ſome mention made of theſe Doctrines, if theſe divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had believed and taught them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Above all, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the particular deſigne of their Tracts and Diſputes would evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42025:147"/>oblige them to ſpeak of them in divers places, where they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them. For Example, St. <hi>Paul</hi> making a long compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> in the ſeventh Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and treating almoſt of no other thing in all that Divine Epiſtle, but of the Prieſthood, was not he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently obliged to ſpeak of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Altar, and of the Species under which he was offered, and ſo myſteriouſly figured ſo many Ages before by the bread and wine of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec?</hi> and nevertheleſs he ſaith not a word of it. What do I ſay, that he ſaid not a word of it? he hath done more. For inſtead of ſaying theſe things ſo neceſſary to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject according to the Hypotheſis of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he ſayeth others of it, which ſhakes it ſo rudely, that the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's of his Sacrifice were all ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at it, their Doctors ſweating unprofitably to make theſe agree with their belief.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the eleventh of the firſt to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Apoſtle chaſtiſeth the irreverence of the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42025:148"/>in the celebrating of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament who mixed their meals with the Communion of the Lord, could he alledge to them upon this Subject any thing more to the purpoſe than the Tranſubſtantiation and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, ſhewing them, that it is not bread which we receive in the Euchariſt, that it is the Lord of Glory, the very body which was crucified for us upon the Croſs? What Romiſh Doctor is there who being to treat of this Subject doth not uſe this reaſon at the beginning, middle, and end of his Diſpute? But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith nothing of it, and (that which is altogether ſtrange) very far from ſpeaking ſo, in ſpeaking of the Sacrament, he calls it Bread three times.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in divers places of his Epiſtles, as namely in the
12 Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the fourth of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> in the third of the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and elſewhere, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all along the duties of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well for their piety towards God, as for their charity towards
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42025:148"/>their Neighbours. But he ſaith not a word of their ſecret Confeſſion, nor of their Invocation of Saints, nor of their worſhipping of Images, nor of any ſuch-like things.</p>

               <p>Ninthly,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp;</hi>
5.1.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the beginning of his Epiſtle is qualified with the Title of the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt; and in the laſt Chapter recommends to the Prieſts the duty of their charge, and to make them value his admonition, he alledges to them only that he is an Elder amongſt them. Why did he not take in ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the name of Monarch of the Church, or, <hi>Of Servant of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> that is to ſay, the firſt and higheſt of all the Officers of God, which are in the world: no body can be ignorant, but that it would have been an imprudence near to ſtupidity of theſe holy Authors to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten theſe things in ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places if they had believed them? But their Writings (although we knew no other things of them) doth enough juſtifie to us their wiſdom and dexterity in judiciouſly uſing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42025:149"/>every thing that might ſerve for their purpoſe. Read St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the firſt Epiſtle of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> and you will not demand other proofs for this. It remains then that we ſay that their ſilence about theſe Doctrines of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo conſtant and ſo univerſal, and even in places where it had been to the purpoſe to alledge them, prove clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they did not know them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. After all, If it be not poſſible to ſhew by the Scriptures that theſe Doctrines have been revealed by the Lord, and taught by his Apoſtles, I do not ſee by what other means one can prove it. For as for the Books of the Antient Doctors, which they commonly call the Fathers, their Authority is not great enough, nor the teſtimonies which they render of theſe Doctrines evident enough to ground them upon, and to oblige us neceſſarily to put them amongſt the Articles of our Faith, as we have (in my Opinion) ſufficiently ſhewed in a Treatiſe which we have publiſhed upon this Subject. And as to the Authority of the Roman Church which now is, it is as doubtful and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42025:150"/>incredible as all the other Articles which they aſſert, ſo that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve to prove that they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Apoſtolique. Since then that the Articles of our faith are in the Scriptures, and thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> are not there, it is clear that our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is certain and aſſured, as founded upon the moſt authentick Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtianity, and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rejected without denying Chriſtianity it ſelf; and that of <hi>Rome</hi> on the contrary in that wherein it differs from ours, is doubtful and uncertain, and cannot be imbraced with a full and intire faith.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But I ſay in the ſecond place, that all this Diſpute is out of our way: For my deſigne is only to ſhew that our Beliefs are in the Scriptures, and that thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are not there; to deſtroy the accuſations of the Methodiſts who pretend that to eſtabliſh our faith, we are obliged to have recourſe to other Principles than Scripture. Whether the Beliefs of <hi>Rome</hi> be found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Documents of Chriſtianity, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42025:150"/>in Books of the Fathers, or no, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Queſtion. 'Tis ſufficient at preſent for me that they are not found in Scripture. Now this being ſo, it is clear that I have had reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them from my Confeſſion, ſince I receive nothing into it but what is taught in Scripture. And this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (as all may ſee) to juſtifie our Faith by the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, The Scripture ſaith, that the Lord is above, ſitting at the right hand of God his Father in a Sovereign Glory.

               <p>WHoſoever will diligently read the Scriptures, will finde many other things there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42025:159"/>with the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But this little proof is ſufficient for our deſigne. I know our Adverſaries endeavour to ſhun theſe blows, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe uſe many diſtictions. But for the moſt part ſo ſtrange, that 'tis not poſſible to comprehend them; they wrap up things in inexplicaple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; as 'tis eaſie to be ſeen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon the Subject of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiaon, of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, of the ſervice to Saints and their Images. Secondly, All of them preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Opinion, and live by the paſſion wch they have for it. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before ever they had eſtabliſhed Tranſubſtantiation, the world never heard ſpeak of a body which hath its quantity, and not the manner of its quantity; which ſhould be in many places at a time, which penetrates the dimenſions of another body, which hath all its parts confounded under one point, and not diſtinctly extended the one out of the place of the other; neither of Accidents which ſubſiſt without ſubject, a roundneſs without any thing of a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42025:159"/>Circle, a whiteneſs without any thing of white; neither a changing of Subſtances; where the terms in which they were confined was in its full and entire being fifteen or ſixteen years before the change arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So before they had eſtabliſhed the Service and Prayers to the Saints, humane-kinde had never heard that the Religious Services of God were diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Latria, Doulia,</hi> and <hi>Hyperdoulia;</hi> from whence it follows, that before they imploy theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, they are neceſſarily oblig'd firſt, to ground the Opinion which they have produced, and out of which they cannot finde for them neither in Nature, nor in Scripture any ſtay where they may be able to ſubſiſt. I ſhew that the Euchariſt is not a humane body, becauſe it hath not the quantity of it; that it is not the body of the Lord, becauſe the body of the Lord is in Heaven. To that theſe Gentlemen anſwer, that the Euchariſt hath the quantity of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, but it hath not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, that is to ſay, it is five or 6 foot long, although all its length is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42025:160"/>not extended more than two fingers; that the body of Chriſt is in Heaven indeed, but according to its manner of natural exiſtence, and that it is in the ſame time ſubſtantially elſewhere in a certain manner of exiſtence, the which though it can hardly be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by words, is nevertheleſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to God. Now what light doth theſe diſtinctions carry to the Subjects where they are imployed? Do not they confound all our thoughts? Do not they redouble the darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diſſipating it? And indeed what other things do they, except to repeat the ſame thing that is in Queſtion? for when a body hath its quantity and not the manner of it, and that he ſhould ſubſiſt in one place in one manner, and in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be in an infinite other places in another manner, this I ſay, is not grounded but upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation without which never any of them would have thought to affirm things ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent. One ought then to begin by the proof of this pretended Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For till they have grounded
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42025:160"/>this well, their diſtinctions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful, and our proofs clear and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. Now we have ſhew'd here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that they cannot prove by the Scriptures any of the places which they uſe to this end, nor infer any thing like it. There is then no need to examine their diſtinctions. Since 'tis thus, 'tis an injuſtice in them to make uſe of them; and it would be loſt time to me to ſtay to conſider &amp; confute them. In a word, we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed this ſecond means for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of proofs, and not by any neceſſity that obligeth us to it. For although the Doctrines of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not oppoſe (as they do viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) ſo many truths of the Holy Scriptures, it ſhould be always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us not to receive them, ſince they cannot be proved by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſufficiently, in my Opinion, juſtified our faith by the Scriptures, having ſhewed that they teach clearly the Articles which we believe, and that they aſſert neither directly nor indirectly, but rather ſhake and deſtroy thoſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42025:161"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> which we reject. From whence it appears that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſon and truth which ſome of our adverſaries reproach us with, that we cannot prove by the Scriptures, no not one Article of our controverſed faith, inſtead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that it is upon them that the blame falls. Being evident that of all the Beliefs which they preſs us to believe with them, they have not been able hitherto, nor will they ever be able to ground any of them upon the Scriptures. Pray God enlighten them, and confirm us in the knowledge of his truth, and give to both of us the ſpirit of Peace and Charity, to treat our Differences with ſweetneſs convenient to the Profeſſion which we make of being Chriſtians.</p>
